# VistaX — Overview & Risk Expectations

VistaX is one of the two trading softwares included in the kazpa Vista Suite.

It is designed for **experienced users** who understand drawdown, margin behavior, and the responsibility required when running session-based automation.

VistaX is **not beginner-friendly**, not passive, and not designed for constant unattended operation.

---

## What VistaX Is

VistaX is a **session-based trading software** that runs inside **MetaTrader 5 (MT5)**.

Its purpose is to:
- Execute trades during specific, user-defined windows
- Operate in higher-volatility market conditions
- Prioritize performance over comfort
- Require active risk awareness and supervision

VistaX enforces rules.
It does not reduce responsibility.

---

## Market & Timeframe

- Instrument: **XAUUSD (Gold)**
- Timeframe: **M5**

Gold is inherently volatile and reacts strongly to liquidity shifts, news, and market sentiment.
This makes it unsuitable for passive or inexperienced use.

---

## Intended Use Case

VistaX is built to:
- Run during specific trading sessions
- Be turned ON and OFF intentionally
- Be monitored closely while active
- Be paused outside approved windows

Typical usage involves:
- Short execution windows (often 1–2 hours)
- Full user awareness while AutoTrading is enabled
- Turning AutoTrading OFF immediately after the session ends

VistaX should **not** be left running continuously.

---

## Risk Profile (Very Important)

VistaX carries a **moderate to high risk profile**.

Key realities:
- Drawdown can occur quickly
- Margin usage must be understood
- Improper risk configuration can lead to significant losses
- Faster execution does not mean safer execution

VistaX requires **deliberate risk management**.

---

## Monitoring & Control Requirements

Users running VistaX are expected to:
- Be present or actively monitoring while it runs
- Understand margin and exposure
- Pause execution during:
  - major news events
  - abnormal volatility
  - unexpected behavior
- Turn AutoTrading OFF immediately outside session windows

Leaving VistaX unattended is irresponsible.

---

## Who VistaX Is Best For

VistaX is appropriate for users who:
- Have experience with trading automation
- Understand drawdown and margin mechanics
- Are comfortable managing higher volatility
- Prefer session-based execution
- Accept higher responsibility and stress

VistaX assumes the user understands risk **before** running it.

---

## Who VistaX Is NOT For

VistaX is not appropriate for users who:
- Are new to trading or automation
- Want passive income
- Expect low or slow drawdown
- Do not want to monitor execution
- Are uncomfortable with gold volatility
- Want guaranteed outcomes

If any of the above apply, VistaX should not be used.

---

## Common Misconceptions

VistaX is often misunderstood as:
- “A faster version of VistaONE”
- “Higher profits with the same risk”
- “Something you can leave running”

These assumptions are incorrect.

VistaX is **more demanding**, not easier.

---

## Relationship to VistaONE

VistaX and VistaONE serve **different purposes**.

- VistaONE prioritizes consistency and lower stress
- VistaX prioritizes session-based execution and higher risk

Users should not progress to VistaX simply for performance reasons.
Fit and experience matter more than speed.

---

## Final Perspective

VistaX exists for users who:
- Respect volatility
- Accept drawdown
- Understand margin
- Operate with discipline during defined sessions

VistaX does not remove risk.
It concentrates it.

---

## Next Step

If VistaX aligns with your experience level and risk tolerance:
- Review risk controls carefully
- Practice on demo
- Understand margin behavior
- Only run during approved sessions

If not, VistaONE is the more appropriate starting point.
