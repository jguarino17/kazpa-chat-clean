# Risk, Drawdown & Responsibility — Read Before Proceeding

This page explains how risk works when using kazpa software and what users must understand **before** running any automation.

If you are uncomfortable with risk, drawdown, or responsibility, do not proceed.

---

## Trading Risk (Non-Negotiable Truth)

Trading involves risk.
Losses are possible.
Drawdown is normal.

kazpa does not eliminate risk.
kazpa structures execution.

There are **no guarantees** of profit, performance, or outcomes.

---

## What Drawdown Means

Drawdown refers to a temporary decline in account equity due to losing or unrealized trades.

Important realities:
- Drawdown will occur
- Drawdown size varies by risk configuration
- Drawdown tolerance is personal and account-specific
- No system avoids drawdown entirely

Periods of drawdown do **not** mean the software is broken.
They are a normal part of trading systems.

## Automation vs Gambling (Common Question)

Automation is often misunderstood as gambling.

Key distinction:
- Gambling = emotional, random, unstructured decisions
- kazpa automation = rules-based execution with user-defined risk

Automation removes emotional execution.
It does **not** remove uncertainty or loss.

If a user runs automation irresponsibly, results will reflect that behavior.

---

## “Can I Lose Money?”

Yes.

This must always be understood clearly:
- Losses are possible
- Drawdown can be uncomfortable
- Improper risk settings increase losses
- Market conditions change

Users must be prepared for losing periods.

---

## Passive Income Clarification

kazpa is **not passive income**.

Automation:
- Executes trades automatically
- Still requires monitoring
- Still requires risk decisions
- Still requires user responsibility

If you are seeking hands-off income or zero involvement, kazpa is not appropriate.

---

## User-Controlled Risk Levers

Users control:
- Account size
- Risk mode and configuration
- Lot sizing
- When AutoTrading is ON or OFF
- Trade windows (especially for VistaX)
- Whether execution is paused during news or holidays

kazpaGPT may explain these concepts,
but will never tell users exact settings.

---

## Demo First Principle

Demo testing is strongly encouraged.

Demo use allows users to:
- Understand system behavior
- Experience drawdown without real capital
- Learn monitoring expectations
- Adjust risk comfort before going live

Demo results do not guarantee live results.

---

## Responsible Use Expectations

Users are expected to:
- Monitor execution
- Pause automation when appropriate
- Understand the market being traded
- Accept drawdown as part of the process
- Stop if risk exceeds personal tolerance

Turning AutoTrading OFF is a valid and responsible decision.

---

## When kazpa Is NOT a Fit

kazpa may not be appropriate if you:
- Want guaranteed results
- Cannot tolerate drawdown
- Want passive income
- Do not want to monitor trades
- Expect automation to remove responsibility

Disqualification protects both the user and kazpa.

---

## Final Risk Perspective

kazpa provides professional trading software.

Success depends on:
- Discipline
- Risk control
- Monitoring
- Patience
- Realistic expectations

kazpa does not remove risk.
It enforces structure.

Only proceed if this aligns with how you think about trading.
