1.4 Important notices
                                       * High risk: Trading Forex/CFDs involves significant risk of loss. Only trade with capital you can afford to lose. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

                                       * Educational use only: All content is for education and software operation guidance. It is not financial advice and not an offer to buy/sell any instrument.

                                       * No recommendations: kazpa does not recommend or endorse any broker, VPS, or third-party provider. Do your own research and choose providers that meet your requirements.

                                       * Your responsibility: You operate your own account. You choose when to run, pause, or stop the softwares. You’re responsible for all trading outcomes.

                                       * Licensing: Your license is personal and tied to your MT5 account number. Changing accounts or brokers requires re-licensing via the member dashboard.

2.1 The kazpa softwares (VistaONE & VistaX)
Purpose:
 Understand what each software is built for and how they fit together inside your account.
VistaONE — Precision & Stability
                                          * Designed for steady, lower-risk growth.

                                          * Trades fewer sequences per day but focuses on high-probability structures.

                                          * Best suited for users who value smoother equity curves and tighter drawdowns.

VistaX — Aggressive Compounding
                                             * Built for capital acceleration.

                                             * Trades more frequently, uses controlled sequencing logic, and compounds faster.

                                             * Designed for members who understand higher drawdown tolerance.

How they work together:
 Running both creates the full VistaSuite experience — VistaONE stabilizes growth, while VistaX scales it. Both use the same risk-control foundation and licensing system.

2.2 Mastering Lot Sizes (Simple Guide)
Why this matters:
 Lot size controls how much of your account is exposed per trade. Too high = faster gains but higher risk. Too low = slower growth.
Lot logic used in kazpa softwares:
                                                * Each software uses a capped-lot system based on your account equity.

                                                * Example (cap values vary per update):

Account Size
	Typical Lot Cap
	Approx Daily Goal
	$10 000
	0.10
	1 – 1.5 %
	$25 000
	0.25
	1 %
	$50 000
	0.50
	0.8 %
	$100 000
	1.00
	0.6 %
	                                                   * 
                                                   * The cap adjusts automatically with equity changes.

                                                   * Avoid manually overriding unless you fully understand the math.

                                                   * Always think “preserve first → compound later.”

2.3 Autotrading Basics (When to Turn On / Off)
Autotrading = automation enabled in MT5.
 When the icon 🟢 is on, the software executes trades automatically.
General best practice:
                                                      * Keep it on only when you’re fully set up and connected.

                                                      * Pause before major news events (NFP, FOMC, CPI releases).

                                                      * Don’t turn it on/off mid-trade sequence.

                                                      * Disable on weekends when markets close.

Check this before turning ON:
                                                         * VPS connected / stable internet

                                                         * License status = Active

                                                         * Correct symbol and timeframe loaded

                                                         * No errors in “Experts” tab

2.4 Risk Management with Softwares
Goal: Protect capital first — profit comes from consistency.
Core principles built into kazpa softwares:
                                                            1. Daily profit target → Once reached, stop trading manually.

                                                            2. Max drawdown limit → If reached, stop the day and review.

                                                            3. Auto-lot logic → Adjusts exposure relative to equity.

                                                            4. Equity protection → Software avoids entering new trades if conditions are unfavorable.

Manual rules for members:
                                                               * Never increase lot sizes after a loss sequence to “make it back.”

                                                               * Withdraw periodically — profit means nothing until secured.

                                                               * Review your MyFXBook data weekly.

2.5 Accessing Your Softwares
                                                                  1. Log in to your kazpa member dashboard.

                                                                  2. Go to “Downloads.”

                                                                  3. You’ll see links for VistaONE and VistaX files and your license status.

                                                                  4. If your license shows Inactive, complete the License Activation Form first.

                                                                  5. Once Active, download the files and save them to your VPS.

2.6 Algorithmic Trading 101 (Plain English)
What it is:
 Algorithmic trading (“algo trading”) means using pre-programmed logic to analyze market data and place trades automatically.
How kazpa softwares operate:
                                                                     * Each software scans price structures and market patterns 24/5.

                                                                     * When specific conditions are met, it executes based on its parameters and risk logic.

                                                                     * It removes emotion and guesswork — but you must still manage environment and risk.

What it is not:
                                                                        * Not a get-rich-quick button.

                                                                        * Not hands-free — you still monitor performance and VPS connection.

Mindset:
 Think of the software as a “driver.” You set the destination (risk and account size); it drives by rules you understand.

2.8 Common Mistakes to Avoid
                                                                              1. Installing the files in the wrong MT5 folder.

                                                                              2. Forgetting to enable “Algo Trading.”

                                                                              3. VPS sleep mode causing software to stop.

                                                                              4. Changing brokers without updating your license.

                                                                              5. Opening charts on the wrong timeframe.

                                                                              6. Expecting identical results to someone else (different broker feeds = different ticks).

                                                                              7. Ignoring the Experts tab errors — always check for messages after installation.

3.1 Virtual Private Server (VPS)
Purpose
 A VPS is a Windows-based remote computer that stays online 24 / 5 so your MetaTrader 5 and kazpa softwares can run even when your personal device is off.
What you need to know
                                                                                 * Choose a VPS with solid uptime (99 % +) and a server location close to your broker’s trading server for low latency.

                                                                                 * Minimum spec: 2 CPU cores, 4 GB RAM, 20 GB storage, Windows Server 2019 or newer.

                                                                                 * You’ll access it through Remote Desktop Connection (RDP).

Checklist before continuing
 ☑ Windows Server installed
☑ Internet speed stable
☑ RDP login confirmed
☑ MT5 installation allowed (you can download files)

3.2 Brokers
Purpose
 Your broker executes trades from your kazpa softwares on the live market.
Educational notes
                                                                                    * A broker provides the trading server, spreads, and leverage.

                                                                                    * kazpa softwares require a 1 : 500 leverage account to operate as designed.

                                                                                    * Compare brokers by regulation, spreads, execution speed, funding methods, and customer service.

                                                                                    * Always open an MT5 account (not MT4).

What to collect
                                                                                       * Broker name + server address (e.g. Broker-Live2)

                                                                                       * Account number and password

                                                                                       * Leverage setting (verify 1 : 500)

                                                                                       * Deposit method you plan to use

3.3 Funding Your Broker Account
Purpose
 You need funded capital (or demo balance) before installation.
Guidelines
                                                                                          * Only fund what you can afford to risk.

                                                                                          * Use the broker’s secure portal; kazpa never handles deposits or withdrawals.

                                                                                          * Keep proof of deposit for your records.

                                                                                          * Wait until funds show as available equity in MT5 before activating the softwares.

                                                                                                                        * Daily Target – (if included) use default unless you fully understand risk.

                                                                                                                        * Magic Number – identifies this software’s trades (keep default).

Tips
                                                                                                                           * Keep defaults during initial setup.

                                                                                                                           * Let the software run uninterrupted for at least a full trading session before making changes.

                                                                                                                           * Always test changes on a demo account first.

4.3 VistaX — Setup
Purpose
 VistaX focuses on calculated compounding. It trades more frequently and uses intelligent sequencing to grow equity faster while maintaining protective logic.
Attaching to a chart
                                                                                                                              * Works best on XAUUSD (Gold).

                                                                                                                              * Timeframe: M5 recommended.

                                                                                                                              * Use on a separate chart from VistaONE.

Settings overview
                                                                                                                                 * Lot Cap – sets the max lot allowed per sequence.

                                                                                                                                 * Sequence Limit – controls how many positions the logic can open at once.

                                                                                                                                 * Auto-risk logic – adjusts exposure as equity changes.

                                                                                                                                 * Max Drawdown Stop – built-in protective threshold.

Best practices
                                                                                                                                    * Do not interfere mid-sequence. Let the software complete its cycle.

                                                                                                                                    * Review trade history weekly.

                                                                                                                                    * If you change account balance significantly (deposit/withdraw), recheck your risk plan.

4.4 Running Multiple Terminals / Instances
If you plan to run VistaONE and VistaX simultaneously, use two separate MT5 terminals on your VPS.
Each terminal = one software = one chart.
Steps
                                                                                                                                       1. Copy your MT5 installation folder (e.g. MetaTrader 5 – Copy).

                                                                                                                                       2. Launch both terminals separately.

                                                                                                                                       3. Log each terminal into the same or different broker accounts as needed.

                                                                                                                                       4. Attach VistaONE to one terminal, VistaX to the other.

Why this matters
                                                                                                                                          * Prevents software overlap and chart conflicts.

                                                                                                                                          * Improves VPS stability.

                                                                                                                                          * Keeps trade journaling clean and separated.

5.1 Tracking Performance (MyFXBook)
Purpose
 To verify and analyze your trading data — not just profits, but drawdowns, win rate, and equity growth over time.
What is MyFXBook?
 MyFXBook is a free performance-tracking tool that connects directly to your MT5 account. It displays verified trade history, live charts, and metrics.
Setup steps
                                                                                                                                                   1. Go to myfxbook.com.

                                                                                                                                                   2. Create an account → “Add Account.”

                                                                                                                                                   3. Choose MetaTrader 5 Auto Update (or manual if required).

                                                                                                                                                   4. Enter your MT5 login and server (read-only connection — no trade permission).

                                                                                                                                                   5. Wait for the sync confirmation.

What to review once connected
                                                                                                                                                      * Balance vs. Equity Curve → shows growth consistency.

                                                                                                                                                      * Drawdown % → shows the deepest dips your account experienced.

                                                                                                                                                      * Profit Factor & Win Rate → measures performance efficiency.

                                                                                                                                                      * Daily / Monthly Returns → helps spot patterns over time.

Tip: Check your MyFXBook once a week. Use data to make informed decisions, not emotions.

5.2 Troubleshooting (Fast Fixes)
If something isn’t working, start here. These cover 90% of common issues.
🧩 Software not trading
Cause: Algo Trading is off or chart timeframes are incorrect.
Fix:
                                                                                                                                                         * Confirm the green “Algo Trading” button is ON.

                                                                                                                                                         * Confirm your chart is on the correct timeframe (usually M5 or M15).

                                                                                                                                                         * Check “Experts” tab → if red text appears, read the message.

⚡ VPS disconnected or rebooted
Cause: Your VPS provider restarted or timed out.
Fix:
                                                                                                                                                            * Reconnect via Remote Desktop.

                                                                                                                                                            * Check if MT5 is still running — if not, reopen it.

                                                                                                                                                            * Re-enable “Algo Trading.”

                                                                                                                                                            * Make sure your VPS power settings are set to Always On.

🧾 MT5 build mismatch or update
Cause: MetaTrader updated automatically and temporarily disabled custom softwares.
Fix:
                                                                                                                                                               * Restart MT5.

                                                                                                                                                               * If problem persists, re-copy your .ex5 files into MQL5/Experts.

                                                                                                                                                               * Reattach to chart and check license status.

                                                                                                                                                                     * Keep each on its own chart and workspace.

5.3 Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Can I use demo and live accounts?
 A: Yes. Each license is tied to one MT5 account number. You can request a switch anytime through the activation form.
Q: What if I change brokers?
 A: Submit your new account number under License Activation and wait for re-approval before reinstalling.
Q: What if I lose internet or VPS disconnects mid-trade?
 A: When MT5 reconnects, the software automatically continues managing open trades. Always confirm it reconnected properly.
Q: Can I install both VistaONE and VistaX on the same account?
 A: Yes, but they must be in separate terminals. Running both on the same chart or terminal can cause conflicts.
Q: How often should I update the software?
 A: Only when kazpa releases new builds. Updates are announced inside your member dashboard.
Q: Do I need to change any default settings?
 A: No. Default settings are optimized. Only change settings if you fully understand the risk implications.
