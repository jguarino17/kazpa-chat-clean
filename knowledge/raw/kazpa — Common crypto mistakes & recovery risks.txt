1. Sending crypto on the wrong network
Example:
 Sending USDT (TRC-20) to an ERC-20 address.
Why this happens:
* User selects the wrong network during transfer

* Assumes “USDT is USDT” without checking network

Result:
   * Funds may be permanently lost

   * Recovery is often not possible

How to avoid it:
      * Always confirm:

         * Asset (USDT)

         * Network (ERC-20)

         * Address

            * If unsure, send a small test transaction first

2. Copying the wrong wallet address
Cause:
               * Clipboard overwrite

               * Manual typing errors

               * Switching tabs mid-process

Result:
                  * Funds sent to the wrong address cannot be reversed

Prevention:
                     * Copy/paste only

                     * Double-check first and last characters of the address

                     * Never rush

3. Forgetting exchange withdrawal holds
Cause:
                        * Newly purchased crypto

                        * New account security holds

                        * Large transaction flags

What users experience:
                           * “Withdraw” button disabled

                           * Delays of 24–72 hours

Important note:
 This is an exchange policy, not a broker or kazpa issue.

4. Not accounting for network fees
Cause:
                              * Sending full balance without leaving room for fees

Result:
                                 * Transaction fails

                                 * Transfer delayed

Fix:
                                    * Always leave a small buffer for network fees (especially on Ethereum)

5. Expecting instant broker credit every time
Cause:
                                       * Confusing blockchain confirmation with broker processing

Reality:
                                          * Blockchain confirmation is fast

                                          * Broker crediting may take minutes to a few hours depending on internal checks

6. Sending crypto from someone else’s wallet
Cause:
                                             * Friend, third-party service, or shared wallet

Risk:
                                                * Broker may reject or delay credit

                                                * Compliance issues

Best practice:
                                                   * Use a wallet or exchange account you personally control

7. Losing access to exchange or wallet
Cause:
                                                      * Forgotten passwords

                                                      * Lost 2FA device

                                                      * Email access lost

Prevention:
                                                         * Secure backups

                                                         * Recovery codes saved offline

                                                         * 2FA properly configured

8. Assuming crypto transfers are anonymous
Reality:
                                                            * Blockchain transactions are public

                                                            * Exchanges perform identity checks

                                                            * Records exist indefinitely

Always assume transactions are traceable.

9. No transaction records kept
Why this matters:
                                                               * Taxes

                                                               * Support inquiries

                                                               * Proof of transfer

Fix:
                                                                  * Save transaction IDs (TXIDs)

                                                                  * Download exchange history periodically

Bottom line
Crypto is fast and efficient — but mistakes are final.
Move slowly, verify everything, and treat every transaction as irreversible.
