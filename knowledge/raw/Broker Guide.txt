Broker Guide
________________


In the financial markets, particularly in forex trading, a broker serves as the intermediary between traders and the global market. For forex, a broker provides individual traders and institutional investors with access to the foreign exchange market.
To trade in Forex, you will need to select a broker in order to deposit money and trade with any algorithms. A broker acts like a bank for trading funds, much like brokers you might have used for your 401k, trading in the Stock Exchange, or investing in mutual funds, etc. 
Brokers facilitate your trades by:
* Providing trading platforms
* Executing buy and sell orders
* Offering market analysis tools
* Managing various aspects of trading accounts
It is up to you to choose the correct broker for your needs. You will need a broker with 1:500  leverage (as low as 1:200 is ok). Only brokers foreign to the US offer this leverage, as US brokers only offer 1:50 leverage due to regulations. If you have questions about what leverage is, check out this article here. 
This guide gives some options of brokers you can select. There are far more brokers available than those in this guide, and these brokers are not necessarily our recommendations. 
⚠️ Important Notice
kazpa does not provide support for signing up with brokers or managing broker accounts. Please conduct independent research and choose a broker that aligns with your specific needs. In addition to the information below, we recommend you do your own research before selecting a broker

Broker Login
Most brokers offer an online portal where you can manage your trading account. This portal allows access to account details, deposits, withdrawals, and trading settings. Remember that your MetaTrader credentials may differ from those you use on the broker's website.
Here are the steps you need to take with your broker in order to begin trading:
1. Select a broker
2. Complete the sign-up process, including any verification necessary
3. Deposit funds into your account


Once you have access to your account via your account number and password, and funds are in your account, we can help you set up your algorithm in order to begin trading.

MetaTrader Login
Your broker will give you your MetaTrader login info via your account number and password. MetaTrader enables you to carry out various trading operations, such as placing market orders, modifying trades, and utilizing advanced charting tools. Your broker will provide separate credentials specifically for MetaTrader access.
Credentials typically include:
* MT4/5 account number (usually 6-12 digits)
* MT4/5 account password (a randomly generated password)
Example Credentials:
* Login: 100827473
* Password: (hidden for security)
* Server: kazpa-Demo
⚠️ Warning
We will never ask for your MT4/5 account password. Keep this information private.


If you have not yet done so, please review our VPS Guide to select a VPS and install MetaTrader 4 or 5. You will need this in order to download the software to trade with our algorithms. 


Check out our MetaTrader Guide here to setup MetaTrader 4 or 5


Here are some additional things to consider when selecting a broker:


Spread and Commission:
Brokers offer different spreads and commission structures, directly impacting trading costs. Lower spreads and commissions, like those offered by some brokers, can enhance performance, while wider spreads reduce profitability.


Execution Speed:
The speed at which brokers execute trades matters, especially for algorithms. Fast execution prevents price slippage, which can affect overall results.


Liquidity Providers:
Brokers with better liquidity providers deliver more stable prices and reduce slippage, which helps maintain consistency in EA performance.


Server Reliability:
A broker's server reliability is crucial. Poor server uptime can cause missed trades or mismanagement of open positions, harming the algorithm's results.
