⚙️ What Kazpa Is
Kazpa licenses automated trading software engineered for MetaTrader 5 (MT5).
The software executes algorithmic trades based on pre-defined logic while you retain full control of your funds.
* You connect our software to your own broker account.

* Kazpa never has access to your money or credentials.

* Performance depends on market conditions, broker execution, and your risk parameters.

📘 Info: Kazpa’s suite includes VistaONE and VistaX — each designed for different styles of growth and risk.
________________


🚫 What Kazpa Is Not
⚠️ Kazpa does not manage funds, offer financial advice, or provide trading signals.
All software is licensed for educational use only and does not guarantee profits.
________________


⚖️ Risk Notice
⚠️ Trading foreign exchange, metals and CFDs is high-risk and may result in loss of capital.
Always trade with money you can afford to lose.
Past performance is not indicative of future results.
________________


🧩 Software Overview
VistaONE — Long-Term Compounding Software
→ Operates on higher timeframes (H1 – H4)
 → Focuses on low-risk, steady growth
 → Trades less frequently and maintains longer positions
→ Ideal for users seeking consistency and controlled exposure
________________


VistaX — Gold Scalping Software
→ Trades XAUUSD (Gold) on the M5 timeframe
 → Higher-frequency, higher-risk strategy built for precision scalps
→ Optimized for speed and short-term volatility
→ Best for experienced users comfortable with drawdown and margin management
⚠️ Warning: VistaX is more aggressive than VistaONE. Use a smaller starting balance and confirm broker settings before running it.
💡 Tip: If you’re new to automated trading, start with VistaONE first to understand behavior and execution before scaling into VistaX.

⚙️ SECTION 2 — VPS SETUP
________________


🧠 Why You Need a VPS
Your VPS (Virtual Private Server) keeps MT5 and your Kazpa software running 24 / 5, even when your computer is off.
Think of it as your remote trading computer — always on, always connected to your broker.
💡 Without a VPS, MT5 stops running whenever you close your laptop or lose internet, meaning the software can’t trade or manage positions.

🌐 Recommended VPS Providers
Most members in the Kazpa network use ForexVPS.net due to its stability and low-latency connections to major brokers.
⚠️ Note: Kazpa does not partner with or endorse any VPS company.
Do your own research — choose a VPS that meets the specs above and offers a data center near your broker.
Alternative Options:
   * Contabo VPS

   * OVHCloud VPS

   * FXVM

   * AccuWeb VPS

💡 Tip:
Ask your broker which data-center location is closest to their servers (e.g., London LD4, New York NY4) — then pick a VPS in that same region for best latency.
📸 [Screenshot: Example of ForexVPS.net plan selection page]
________________


🖥️ Step 1 — Purchase Your VPS
1️⃣ Visit your chosen VPS provider’s website.
2️⃣ Choose a plan that meets or exceeds the specs above.
3️⃣ Select Windows Server 2019 or 2022 as your operating system.
4️⃣ After purchase, you’ll receive:
      * VPS IP address

      * Username (usually “Administrator”)

      * Password

📘 Info: You’ll use this information to connect via Remote Desktop Connection (RDP).
________________


💻 Step 2 — Connect to Your VPS
🔹 Windows Users
1️⃣ Press Start → Remote Desktop Connection.
2️⃣ Enter your VPS IP address → click Connect.
3️⃣ When prompted, enter your:
         * Username: Administrator

         * Password: (from your VPS email)
 4️⃣ Click OK → you’re now inside your VPS!

📸 [Screenshot: Windows RDP Connection Window with IP and Username entered]
________________


🔹 Mac Users
1️⃣ Download Microsoft Remote Desktop from the App Store.
2️⃣ Open the app → click Add PC.
3️⃣ Enter:
            * PC Name: (your VPS IP)

            * Password: (your VPS password)
4️⃣ Double-click to connect → your Windows VPS desktop opens.

📸 [Screenshot: Microsoft Remote Desktop App settings on Mac]
________________


🔐 Step 3 — Secure Your VPS
⚠️ Security Matters — treat your VPS like your personal trading computer.
✔ Change Your Password immediately after first login.
✔ Disable Sleep Mode / Auto Lock (so MT5 never pauses).
✔ Install Windows Updates manually when the market is closed.
✔ Do not install unnecessary software — keep it clean and fast.
💡 Tip:
Set Windows updates to notify you first instead of auto-restarting (to prevent MT5 restarts mid-trade).
📸 [Screenshot: Windows Settings > Power & Sleep > Set to Never]
________________


🧩 Step 4 — Prepare Your VPS for MT5
1️⃣ Open Microsoft Edge (or Chrome) on the VPS.
2️⃣ Download MT5 from your broker’s website — not from MetaQuotes directly.
3️⃣ Install MT5 → open and log in using your broker credentials.
4️⃣ Once connected, you’ll see:
               * Account balance

               * Market quotes

               * Open charts

📸 [Screenshot: MT5 terminal after successful login]
________________


💡 Connection Tip
In MT5 → Tools > Options > Server, check your ping to the broker.
Lower is better — ideally under 50 ms.
If your ping is high:
➡ Move your VPS region closer to the broker’s data center.
➡ Contact your VPS provider for assistance.
📸 [Screenshot: MT5 Server Ping Status Window]
________________


🧭 Step 5 — Keep Your VPS Running 24 / 5
⚙️ Kazpa software requires MT5 to run continuously while markets are open (Monday → Friday).
✅ Leave MT5 open on your VPS at all times.
✅ You can close the RDP window — the VPS stays active.
✅ Reconnect any time to monitor progress or make adjustments.
✅ Avoid shutting down your VPS unless absolutely necessary.
📘 Info: When you disconnect from RDP, the VPS keeps running in the cloud. You’re simply logging out of the view.

💼 SECTION 3 — BROKER SETUP
________________


🧠 Why Choosing the Right Broker Matters
Your broker is the bridge between your Kazpa software and the live markets.
Even with perfect software and a fast VPS, poor broker conditions (like high spreads or bad execution) can ruin performance.
⚙️ Goal: Choose a broker that’s fast, regulated, and offers low-spread, RAW or PRO account types for the best algo performance.
________________


✅ Broker Requirements
Requirement
	Recommendation
	Why It Matters
	Platform
	MetaTrader 5 (MT5)
	All Kazpa software is built for MT5.
	Account Type
	RAW / ECN / PRO
	Tight spreads and faster execution for automation.
	Leverage
	1 : 500 (or highest available)
	Allows proper margin allocation during trade sequences.
	Hedging Enabled
	✅ Required
	Kazpa software opens hedge positions for risk control.
	Spread
	0.0 – 1.5 pips (XAUUSD under 30)
	Lower spread = lower trading cost.
	Execution Type
	Market Execution
	No requotes, better order flow for EAs.
	Commission
	$5 – $7 per lot RT typical
	Normal for RAW / PRO accounts.
	Server Uptime
	99.9 %+
	Prevents disconnections that pause trading.
	________________


🧩 RAW / PRO vs Standard Accounts
⚙️ RAW / PRO Accounts
→ Tightest spreads (often 0.0 – 0.2 pips)
→ Small commission per trade
→ Designed for algorithmic trading and scalping
→ Faster execution & less slippage
💡 Best for: VistaONE & VistaX — both rely on precise entries and efficient order handling.
📘 Info: Most professionals and automated systems use RAW / ECN / PRO accounts because the total cost (spread + commission) is lower and execution quality is better.
________________


⚙️ Standard Accounts
→ No direct commission but higher spreads
→ Slower execution speed
→ Less transparent pricing
→ Fine for manual traders — not ideal for automation
⚠️ Warning: Standard accounts can inflate entry prices, reduce accuracy and negatively affect risk/reward on scalping software like VistaX.
________________


🏁 Our Network’s Common Choices
While Kazpa does not recommend or endorse any specific broker, the following MT5 brokers are commonly used within our network due to their trading conditions, stability, and availability of RAW / PRO account types:
                  * OX Securities – RAW Account

                  * Trade Smart – PRO Account

                  * Plexy Trade – RAW Account

                  * Blaze Markets – PRO / ECN Account

                  * 1XTrade – RAW Account

                  * PupPrime – ECN Account

                  * LQH Markets – RAW Account

📘 Info: These brokers are simply examples based on what many Kazpa users choose.
You should always conduct your own independent research, compare fees, regulations, and performance, and select a broker that aligns with your own needs and region.
⚠️ Important Notice:
Kazpa has no broker partnerships, affiliations, or commissions from any broker listed here.
You are solely responsible for verifying that your broker is legitimate, regulated, and MT5 compatible with the correct trading conditions (RAW / PRO / ECN accounts, hedging enabled, and reliable execution).
📸 [Screenshot: Example of a broker’s “RAW / PRO Account” selection page]
________________


🪙 Step 1 — Open Your Broker Account
1️⃣ Go to your chosen broker’s website.
2️⃣ Open a Live MT5 account.
3️⃣ Select RAW / PRO / ECN account type.
4️⃣ Choose 1 : 500 leverage (or your broker’s maximum).
5️⃣ Make sure hedging is enabled during setup.
6️⃣ Complete KYC verification (upload ID + proof of address).
7️⃣ Once approved, fund your account with your starting balance.
📘 Tip: Always start small. You can scale your balance once you’ve verified performance and stability on live connection.
📸 [Screenshot: Example of broker account creation form – leverage & account type fields highlighted]
________________


⚙️ Step 2 — Get Your Server Login Details
Once your broker approves the account, you’ll receive an email with:
                     * Server Name: (e.g. ICMarketsSC-Live09)

                     * Login ID: Your trading account number

                     * Password: Generated by broker

                     * MT5 Download Link

💡 Save this email — you’ll need these credentials when you log in to MT5 on your VPS.
📸 [Screenshot: Example of broker welcome email with MT5 credentials]
________________


💻 Step 3 — Download & Install MT5
1️⃣ From your broker’s email or website, click Download MT5 for Windows.
2️⃣ Install it on your VPS (not your personal computer).
3️⃣ Open MT5 → File > Login to Trade Account.
 4️⃣ Enter the Server, Login ID, and Password provided by your broker.
5️⃣ Click OK — you should see your account balance in the Navigator panel.
📸 [Screenshot: MT5 login window filled out with server & credentials]
________________


🔎 Step 4 — Verify Symbols & Market Access
1️⃣ Right-click inside the Market Watch panel → Show All.
 2️⃣ Ensure your trading symbols appear, especially:
                        * XAUUSD (Gold) for VistaX

                        * Major FX pairs for VistaONE
3️⃣ Confirm the symbol names exactly match your broker’s (e.g. “XAUUSD.a” vs “XAUUSD” matters).
4️⃣ Open a chart → confirm data is loading and prices are moving.

📸 [Screenshot: MT5 Market Watch showing XAUUSD and EURUSD visible]
________________


💰 Step 5 — Fund Your Account
Once you’ve verified that MT5 is connected and working:
1️⃣ Deposit funds through your broker’s client portal.
2️⃣ Verify the balance updates in MT5.
3️⃣ Keep at least 10 – 20 % free margin available at all times for safety.
💡 Tip: Funding with the same currency as your trading pair’s base (e.g. USD for XAUUSD) helps avoid conversion fees.
________________


⚡ Step 6 — Optimize for Algo Trading
🧩 A few quick adjustments can dramatically improve stability.
                           * Disable news pop-ups and alerts (Tools > Options > Notifications).

                           * Make sure Auto Trading is enabled in the MT5 toolbar.

                           * Close any unnecessary charts.

                           * Ensure your broker time zone matches the settings you’ll use in your Kazpa software.

                           * Confirm Hedging Mode (not Netting) under Tools > Options > Trade > Positions.

💡 Tips & Best Practices
💡 Tip 1: Always open a demo account first to test broker spreads, commissions and execution.
💡 Tip 2: Use RAW or PRO accounts — tighter spreads = cleaner execution.
💡 Tip 3: Avoid brokers with mark-ups, slow withdrawals or excessive slippage reports.
💡 Tip 4: Test your broker’s ping speed directly in MT5 (Tools > Options > Server).
💡 Tip 5: Keep the broker’s support contact handy in case you ever need login resets or server clarifications.

📱 SECTION 7 — MT5 MOBILE APP
________________


🧭 Overview
The MT5 mobile app allows you to monitor your Kazpa software and account performance from anywhere.
It’s great for checking trades, balance, and equity in real time — but you should never manually trade or close positions from the app while the software is running.
⚠️ Important: The software runs on your VPS — not your phone.
The mobile app is for viewing only.
________________


✅ What You’ll Need
☑ Active MT5 account (already logged in on your VPS)
☑ Your broker’s MT5 server name (from broker email)
☑ Your MT5 Login ID and Password
________________


📲 Step 1 — Install the App
📱 On iPhone
1️⃣ Open the App Store.
2️⃣ Search for MetaTrader 5.
3️⃣ Tap Get → wait for installation to finish.

6️⃣ Tap Sign In.
📸 [Screenshot: MT5 mobile login screen with broker search and fields filled out]
💡 Tip: If you can’t find your broker’s server, confirm you downloaded MT5 from MetaQuotes, not a broker-branded app.
________________


📈 Step 3 — Monitor Your Account
Once logged in, you can:
✔ View open and closed trades
 ✔ Track balance, equity, and margin level
 ✔ View charts (for observation only)
✔ Review trade history and profit reports
📸 [Screenshot: MT5 mobile “Trade” tab showing open positions]
⚠️ Do Not:
 – Modify or close trades manually while the software is active.
– Change lot sizes or symbols.
– Add or remove indicators from charts linked to software trades.
These actions can interrupt automation and cause trade conflicts.
________________


🧩 Step 4 — Check Connection & Sync
You can confirm your MT5 mobile is synced with your VPS account by checking:
                                    * Account number matches your VPS MT5 terminal

                                    * Trade list matches what’s visible on your VPS screen

                                    * Equity and balance update in real time

💡 Tip:
 If you see “No connection” or “Data loading,” switch between Wi-Fi and cellular or re-login.

 Next ➡️ Section 8: Troubleshooting & Common Fixes — how to identify and solve common issues like “no trades,” “invalid license,” or “trade disabled” messages.






🧰 SECTION 8 — TROUBLESHOOTING & COMMON FIXES
________________


🧭 Overview
Even with the correct setup, small configuration errors or broker issues can stop your software from trading.
This guide shows you how to quickly identify and fix the most common problems inside MT5.
________________


⚠️ Before You Start Troubleshooting
1️⃣ Make sure:
 ✔ You’re on the correct chart & timeframe
   • VistaONE → EURUSD M15
  • VistaX → XAUUSD M5
 ✔ Auto Trading = ON (green)
 ✔ Your .set file is loaded
 ✔ You’ve entered your License Key correctly
 ✔ Your VPS is running and connected to your broker
If all these are correct and it’s still not working, go through the sections below.
________________


🚫 Problem 1: Software Is Not Trading
Possible Causes & Fixes:
🔹 Auto Trading is Off
 → Top toolbar → Click Auto Trading until it turns green.
🔹 Wrong Chart or Timeframe
 → Check you attached the software to:
 • EURUSD M15 (VistaONE)
 • XAUUSD M5 (VistaX)
🔹 Wrong or Missing Set File
 → Right-click chart → Expert Properties → Inputs → confirm settings loaded.
→ If blank, click Load → select the correct .set file and press OK.
🔹 Market Closed
 → Kazpa software only trades when markets are open (Monday – Friday).
🔹 Spread Too High / No Liquidity
 → Check spread in Market Watch. If XAUUSD > 30 pips or execution too slow, wait for spread to normalize.
📘 Info: VistaX may go hours or days without entries if conditions aren’t met — that’s normal and part of its risk control.
________________


🔑 Problem 2: License Error or Invalid Key
Symptoms: “Invalid License”, “No Authorization”, or software won’t activate.
Fix:
 1️⃣ Double-check you copied the license key exactly (no spaces).
2️⃣ Confirm the account number matches the one you submitted on the activation form.
3️⃣ If you changed brokers or accounts, contact Kazpa Support to rebind your license.
4️⃣ Restart MT5 after re-entering the key.
📸 [Screenshot: Experts tab showing “License OK” vs “Invalid License” messages]
________________


🧠 Problem 3: “Trade Disabled” or “Invalid Volume” Message
Causes & Fixes:
 🔹 Lot size below your broker’s minimum or not in correct step increments.
 → Open Market Watch → right-click symbol → Specifications → check Min Lot & Lot Step.
 → Load the official Kazpa set file to auto-correct this.
🔹 Account margin too low.
 → Reduce lot size or add equity.
🔹 Hedging disabled on account.
 → Contact broker to enable hedging (necessary for Kazpa software).
________________


⚙️ Problem 4: MT5 Disconnected / No Connection
Fix:
 1️⃣ Bottom-right status bar → if shows “Invalid Account” or “Common Error”:
 • File → Login to Trade Account → re-enter credentials.
2️⃣ Test ping: Tools → Options → Server → Ping. Should be < 100 ms.
3️⃣ If still high or unstable → contact VPS provider to move closer to broker.
💡 Tip: Avoid Wi-Fi on VPS servers — always wired connections in datacenter for max uptime.
________________


💥 Problem 5: Blue Cap Not Showing
Means: Software is not attached properly or trading disabled.
Fix:
                                       * Re-attach software to chart → confirm set file and license key loaded.

                                       * Make sure Auto Trading is green.

                                       * If still missing, close MT5 → reopen → re-attach software.

🧩 Problem 6: High Drawdown or Margin Warning
Fix:
                                          * Check that you’re using the official Kazpa set file for your balance and risk mode.

                                          * Confirm leverage is 1:500 and account type = RAW / PRO.

                                          * Never run multiple Kazpa software products on one account.

                                          * Keep at least 20 – 30 % free margin available.

📘 Info: If Margin Level drops below 20 %, most brokers trigger a margin call and force-close positions.
________________


🔁 Problem 7: No Data or Chart Frozen
Fix:
                                             * Right-click chart → Refresh.

                                             * If still frozen, right-click Market Watch → “Show All” to reload symbols.

                                             * Restart MT5 if data feed stops.

________________


🧹 Problem 8: Software Stopped After Restart
Fix:
 1️⃣ When MT5 reopens, re-attach software to chart.
2️⃣ Load the correct set file again and verify Auto Trading = ON.
3️⃣ Confirm blue cap icon visible.
💡 Tip: If you use a VPS that restarts weekly for maintenance, reconnect afterward and check your setup.

💰 Refund Policy
All purchases are final.
                                                * The Kazpa license is a digital, one-time product that becomes active once your key is issued.

                                                * Because activation binds a license to a specific account, no refunds can be issued after activation.

                                                * Refunds may only be considered if:

                                                         * Regular updates improve performance and stability; when a new version is released:

✅ End of Section 9 — Policies & Safety
 Next ➡️ Section 10 — Risk Tool (VistaX Only) — we’ll cover how to use the built-in Kazpa Risk Tool to calculate lot sizes, drawdown, and projected performance for gold trading with VistaX.







📊 SECTION 10 — RISK TOOL (VISTAX ONLY)
________________


🧭 Overview
The Kazpa Risk Tool is built directly into your Member Dashboard under its own tab.
It’s an interactive web-based calculator made exclusively for VistaX (Gold) users to understand risk, lot sizing, drawdown, and margin usage in real time.
⚠️ The Risk Tool is for education and planning only.
It does not change settings inside MT5 — it helps you confirm that your VistaX configuration matches your account size and risk level before trading.
________________


✅ Purpose of the Risk Tool
✔ Calculate the recommended starting lot size based on your account balance and risk mode.
✔ Display expected drawdown and margin usage during full trade sequences.
✔ Model realistic outcomes for three preset risk profiles:
 • Conservative • Moderate • Aggressive
📘 Info:
 VistaX trades XAUUSD on M5 with sequence-based logic.
The Risk Tool mirrors that structure so you can visualize how your balance reacts under real trading conditions.
________________


🖥️ Step 1 — Access the Risk Tool
1️⃣ Log in to your Kazpa Member Dashboard.
2️⃣ In the sidebar, click the tab labeled Risk Tool.
3️⃣ The page will load automatically — no downloads, no setup required.
📸 [Screenshot: Member Dashboard sidebar showing “Risk Tool” tab selected]
________________


🧩 Step 2 — Enter Your Inputs
At the top of the page you’ll see an input panel.
➡ Account Balance: Type your total account size (e.g., $50 000).
➡ Risk Mode: Choose Conservative / Moderate / Aggressive.
➡ (Optional) Manual Lot Override — for testing specific scenarios.
As soon as you adjust a value, the calculations update instantly.
📸 [Screenshot: Risk Tool input section with balance + risk mode fields]
________________


📊 Step 3 — Review the Results
The results panel will automatically display:
Metric
	Description
	Recommended Lot Size
	The precise starting lot per your balance & risk mode.
	Trade Sequence View
	Visual of how lots scale during 8 levels of VistaX logic.
	Projected Drawdown %
	Estimated equity drawdown based on real data.
	Margin Usage %
	Approximate margin consumption per sequence.
	Performance Bands
	Expected range of returns under typical market conditions.
	📸 [Screenshot: Risk Tool results panel comparing risk modes]
💡 Tip:
 Use the Conservative mode to see safe baseline exposure, then explore Moderate or Aggressive only if your account and risk tolerance allow it.
________________


⚠️ Step 4 — Confirm Settings Before Trading
Before you run VistaX live:
1️⃣ Confirm the .set file loaded in MT5 matches your selected Risk Mode.
2️⃣ Verify your starting lot size matches the tool’s recommendation.
3️⃣ Check that your leverage = 1 : 500 and Margin Level ≥ 500 %.
4️⃣ Review the Risk Tool one more time whenever you change balance or settings.
⚠️ Mandatory:
 Using the wrong lot size or mismatched set file can lead to excessive drawdown or margin call.
Always verify your numbers in the Risk Tool before activating VistaX.

🧠 Step 5 — Using the Tool for Ongoing Risk Awareness
                                                                     * Revisit the Risk Tool whenever you fund or withdraw from your account.

                                                                     * The displayed metrics update dynamically to reflect your new balance.

                                                                     * Use it to decide whether to scale risk or stay conservative as your account grows.

💡 Tip:
 Many users keep the Risk Tool open in a separate browser tab while viewing their MT5 performance — it makes comparing live margin levels effortless.
