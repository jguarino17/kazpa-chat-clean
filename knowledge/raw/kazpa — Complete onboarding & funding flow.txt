kazpa — Complete onboarding & funding flow
(From payment → ready to run)
Purpose of this document
This guide explains the entire kazpa onboarding journey, including how users are routed between crypto funding and bank funding, depending on speed, location, and broker capabilities.
kazpa provides trading software and education only. Users control broker selection, funding method, risk, and when software runs.
________________


STAGE 1 — Payment completed (kazpa license)
Once payment is completed:
* You receive access to:

   * kazpa documentation

   * setup guides

   * downloads

   * support resources

      * You are not live yet

      * No trading occurs at this stage

Your next objective is to prepare your trading environment.
________________


STAGE 2 — Choose account type: demo or live
Before funding anything, decide:
Option A: Demo account (recommended first)
         * No real capital

         * Ideal for:

            * learning MT5

            * confirming installation

            * understanding software behavior

               * Funding step is skipped

Option B: Live account
                  * Real capital

                  * Requires broker account + funding

                  * Funding method matters (bank vs crypto)

kazpa works the same on demo and live. Risk is the only difference.
________________


STAGE 3 — Broker account setup (before funding)
Regardless of funding method, your broker account must meet these requirements:
                     * MT5 only

                     * Tight spreads / low trading costs
 (often called RAW / ECN / PRO-style depending on broker)

                     * Leverage support: 1:200–1:500

                        * Exact leverage choice is yours

                           * Correct symbol naming for your account type
(example: .raw, .pro, .ecn)

kazpa does not recommend brokers. Broker selection is your responsibility.

STAGE 4 — Funding method decision (routing logic)
At this point, users are routed based on priority and constraints.
kazpaGPT should route users using this logic:
________________


ROUTE A — Crypto funding (fastest & most flexible)
Best for users who:
                              * Want fast access to funds

                              * Need weekend or after-hours funding

                              * Are using non-US brokers

                              * Are comfortable with crypto basics

Key characteristics:
                                 * Available 24/7

                                 * Often credited in minutes

                                 * Lower friction than bank wires

                                 * Not limited by banking hours

Typical flow:
                                    1. Buy or hold crypto (commonly USDT)

                                    2. Send crypto to broker’s deposit address

                                    3. Broker credits account

                                    4. User is ready to continue setup

Important notes:
                                       * Exchanges may place withdrawal holds on newly purchased crypto

                                       * Network selection must match (example: USDT ERC-20)

                                       * Crypto transactions are irreversible

Crypto is often the fastest way to move from “paid” → “ready to trade”.

ROUTE B — Bank funding (slower but familiar)
Best for users who:
                                          * Prefer traditional banking

                                          * Are funding during business days

                                          * Are comfortable waiting longer

                                          * Are using brokers that support local bank rails

Key characteristics:
                                             * Processing time: 2–3 business days or more

                                             * No weekend or holiday processing

                                             * Possible intermediary bank delays

                                             * May require additional verification

Typical flow:
                                                1. Initiate bank transfer (wire or ACH)

                                                2. Wait for processing

                                                3. Broker credits account

                                                4. User continues setup

Bank funding is reliable but slower.
________________


STAGE 5 — Funding completed (checkpoint)
Once funds are visible in your broker account:
                                                   * Confirm balance is correct

                                                   * Confirm leverage is set correctly

                                                   * Confirm correct account type

                                                   * Confirm correct symbols are available in MT5

Do not install software yet if these are not confirmed.
________________


STAGE 6 — VPS setup (recommended)
For consistent execution:
                                                      * Use a VPS

                                                      * Install MT5 on the VPS

                                                      * Log into your broker account inside MT5

                                                      * Keep MT5 running continuously

This step is optional but strongly recommended for live accounts.
________________


STAGE 7 — Software installation
Now you install kazpa software:
Copy files into:

MQL5 → Experts → Advisors
                                                         1.                                                          2. Restart MT5

                                                         3. Open the correct symbol chart

                                                         4. Set correct timeframe:

                                                            * VistaONE → M15

                                                            * VistaX → M5

                                                               5. Attach the software

________________


STAGE 8 — License activation
                                                                  * Complete the license activation process

                                                                  * Confirm software loads without errors

                                                                  * Verify AutoTrading is ON (green)

At this point, the software is installed but not necessarily trading yet.
________________


STAGE 9 — First run expectations
Important mindset:
                                                                     * No trades immediately is normal

                                                                     * Trades only occur when conditions are met

                                                                     * Drawdown is part of trading

                                                                     * You control when AutoTrading is ON or OFF

Do not rush this stage.

STAGE 10 — Live operation & monitoring
Once running:
                                                                        * Monitor execution

                                                                        * Disable AutoTrading during:

                                                                           * major news

                                                                           * low-liquidity periods

                                                                           * platform updates

                                                                              * Review logs if anything looks unusual

kazpa is a tool — you are the operator.

Summary: routing logic (simple)
                                                                                 * Need speed / weekend funding? → Crypto

                                                                                 * Okay with delays / weekdays only? → Bank

                                                                                 * Unsure? → Demo first, then decide

kazpaGPT should always:
                                                                                    * explain both paths

                                                                                    * let the user choose

                                                                                    * never push one as mandatory

                                                                                    * never provide financial advice

Just say where you are in the process.
