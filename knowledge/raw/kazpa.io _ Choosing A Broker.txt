Research Tips:
Use Google to search for 'Best forex brokers with lowest spreads' or 'best offshore forex brokers' for higher leverage options. This will give you a good starting point."
Community Experience:

Understanding Leverage:
Leverage is a tool that allows you to control larger positions with a smaller amount of capital. We generally favor leverage ranging from 1:200 to 1:500 for flexibility and profitability in algorithmic trading."
Regulation and Leverage:
Remember, most regulated brokers in the US offer a maximum of 50x leverage due to regulations. If you're looking for higher leverage, you may need to consider offshore options."
