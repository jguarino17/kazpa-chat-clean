Forex Trading For Beginners


What is Forex?
* It's the largest market in the world
* On an avg day, the market trades 5 trillion dollars
What are you trading?
* You are trading a currency pair
   * Nothing more than the exchange rate between currencies
   * If you travel to Europe, you will exchange USD for EUR
      * The rate of exchange is what you will get back
      * EXAMPLE:
         * The EURO DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE: EUR/USD = 1.0878
            * This means if you wanted 1 EUR you would have to give them 1.0878 USD to get that 1 EUR
            * In this example, 1 EURO is worth 1.0878 USD
How do we make money in the Forex Market?
* We are trading based on the exchange rate between 2 different currencies
   * The way you actually make money is when this exchange rate rises and falls
   * The exchange rates fluctuate depending on the strength and valuation of each of these currencies
      * So if the EUR rises in value, it will cost more USD to get 1 EUR
      * If the USD goes up in value, it is the same thing
      * The opposite is true if the opposite happens
         * If EUR drops then your going to need less USD inorder to get 1 EURO
         * If the USD rises in value, you're going to need less dollars to get 1 EUR
      * EXAMPLE:
         * EUR/USD = 1.0878
            * Place a BUY ORDER
            * Exchange rate goes to 1.0978
               * You make the difference
What is a Currency Pair?
* Top 5 Major Currency Pairs: EURUSD - GBPUSD - USDJPY - AUDUSD - USDCHF
* Each of these is made up of separate currencies.
* Each 3 letter symbol represents a certain currency.
* 1 currencies value against other currencies value which gives us a better interpretation of the value of a certain currency.
   * EXAMPLE:
      * EUR/USD - Consists of 2 Currencies
         * The Base / The Quote
            * EUR/USD has a value of 1.0792
            * Every BASE PAIR always has a value equal to 1.
               * EUR = 1 EUR
               * You're always exchanging 1 of that first pair for whatever the quote pair is.
               * BASE [EUR] = 1 / QUOTE [USD] = 1.0792
      * USD/JPY = 
         * 1st Pair = USD = Base Currency = 1
         * 2nd Pair = JPY = Quote Currency = 110.90
         * If you have 1 USD it is equal to 110.90 JPY & vice versa
   * These are currencies pairs
   * The 1st currency is always the base pair with a value of 1
   * The 2nd currency is always the quote pair which is a quote. It’s the value of the 2nd currency compared to the 1st currency.
What is a Pip? [Non JPY*]
* A Pip is how the forex market moves. It is the smallest amount a currency moves that we care about as traders
* A pip is the smallest number that moves in a currency pair
* A Pip is how we take profit or get stopped out depending on how the trade goes.
   * It’s the 4th place away from the decimal point
   * EXAMPLE:
      * EUR/USD = 1.0787
         * 7 is a Pip
         * What if the price dropped to 1.0786?
            * We dropped 1 Pip
         * 1. | 0 | 7 | 8 | 7
         *  -  |  - |100 | 10 | 1
            * So if the price moved to 1.0796 then The EUR/USD went up 10 Pips
      * AUD/NZD = 1.0248 
         * Goes to 1.0348
            * That is 100 Pips
What is a Pip [With JPY]
* USD/JPY = 110.90
   * Only go 2 decimal places instead of 4
   * 1  | 1 | 0. | 9 | 0
   *  -  |  - |100 | 10 | 1
      * If price went to 110.06 that means we went up 6 pips
      * If price goes to 112.90 that means we went up 200 pips
* GBP/JPY = 130.70
   * Again we only move 2 places from the decimal
