kazpa — Using Forex Factory to stay aware of market-moving news
Purpose of this document
This guide explains how to use Forex Factory’s economic calendar to stay aware of high-impact economic news events that can affect market behavior, volatility, and execution conditions.
kazpa provides trading software and education only. Users are responsible for monitoring risk, market conditions, and when the software runs.

What is Forex Factory?
Forex Factory is a widely used public website that provides:
* an economic calendar

* scheduled news releases

* global market event tracking

The economic calendar shows when major economic data is released and how impactful it is expected to be.
________________


Understanding the “red folder” system
Forex Factory categorizes news by impact level using colored icons.
Red folder events (high impact)
Red folder events indicate high-impact economic releases that often cause:
   * sudden volatility

   * sharp price movements

   * widened spreads

   * slippage

   * erratic execution

Examples of red folder events include:
      * central bank interest rate decisions

      * inflation data (CPI)

      * employment data (such as jobs reports)

      * speeches from central bank officials

These events can significantly change market conditions in a very short period of time.

Why red folder news matters for kazpa users
kazpa software executes trades based on market conditions.
During red folder events:
         * price movement can become unstable

         * spreads can widen unexpectedly

         * execution quality can degrade

         * risk profiles can change rapidly

For this reason, many users avoid running automation during high-impact news.

How to use Forex Factory correctly
Step 1: Set your time zone
            * Visit the Forex Factory calendar

            * Set the calendar time zone to match:

               * your local time, or

               * your VPS time (recommended)

This prevents confusion about when events occur.
________________


Step 2: Filter for red folder events
                  * Use the calendar filters

                  * Enable high-impact (red) events

                  * Optionally hide low-impact events to reduce noise

This allows you to focus only on events that may meaningfully affect the market.
________________


Step 3: Check affected currencies
Each event lists the currency it impacts.
Examples:
                     * USD news → affects USD pairs and correlated markets

                     * EUR news → affects EUR pairs

                     * XAUUSD (gold) is often sensitive to:

                        * USD news

                        * interest rate decisions

                        * inflation data

Understanding which instruments may be affected helps with decision-making.

How kazpa users typically respond to red folder news
This is not advice — it is common risk-management behavior.
Many users choose to:
                           * turn AutoTrading OFF before red folder events

                           * wait until volatility stabilizes

                           * resume execution after the event has passed

Turning AutoTrading OFF is a valid and responsible risk-control action.

Timing considerations
Market impact may occur:
                              * before the scheduled release (anticipation)

                              * at the release (volatility spike)

                              * after the release (follow-through or reversals)

It’s not only the exact release minute that matters.

What kazpa does NOT do
kazpa software:
                                 * does not predict news outcomes

                                 * does not read news feeds

                                 * does not know when events are scheduled

That responsibility remains with the user.

Common mistakes to avoid
                                    * Ignoring high-impact news entirely

                                    * Assuming “the software will handle it”

                                    * Leaving automation on during known volatility spikes

                                    * Forgetting to re-enable AutoTrading after news passes

Simple rule of thumb
If you wouldn’t manually trade during a red folder event, it’s usually not a good time to run automation.
