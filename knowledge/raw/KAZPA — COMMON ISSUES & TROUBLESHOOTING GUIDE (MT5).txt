KAZPA — COMMON ISSUES & TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE (MT5)
This guide covers the most common reasons kazpa software does not behave as expected and how to fix them.
________________


1. Software added to chart but no trades occur
Cause: AutoTrading is OFF
Fix:
* In MT5, ensure the AutoTrading button is ON (green) in the top toolbar.

* If it’s red, the software cannot execute trades.

* After turning it ON, wait for valid market conditions.

________________


2. Software loads but shows a sad face / warning icon
Cause: AutoTrading disabled or permissions not granted
Fix:
   * Right-click the chart → Expert Advisor → Properties

   * Under Common tab:

      * Allow Algo Trading ✅

      * Allow DLL imports (if required by the software) ✅

         * Confirm AutoTrading is ON (green)

3. Software attached to the wrong trading symbol
Cause: Chart symbol does not match account’s pricing type
Example:
            * Using EURUSD instead of EURUSD.pro or EURUSD.raw

Fix:
               * Check your broker’s symbol naming:

                  * .raw, .pro, .ecn, etc.

                     * Remove the software

                     * Open the correct symbol chart

                     * Re-attach the software

⚠️ If the symbol does not match your account type, kazpa software will not trade.

4. Software added to the wrong timeframe
Cause: Chart timeframe does not match software design
Fix:
                        * VistaONE → M15 only

                        * VistaX → M5 only

                        * Remove the software

                        * Change the chart timeframe

                        * Re-attach the software

5. Software does not appear in Navigator
Cause: Files placed in the wrong MT5 folder
Fix:
Files must be placed in:

MQL5 → Experts → Advisors
                           *                            * NOT in:

                              * Indicators

                              * Scripts

                              * Experts root

                                 * Restart MT5 after copying files

________________


6. Software does not trade after installation
Cause: MT5 was not restarted
Fix:
                                    * Fully close MT5

                                    * Reopen MT5

                                    * Re-attach the software to the chart

MT5 does not always refresh new software without a restart.

7. Software shows no errors but still doesn’t trade
Possible causes:
                                       * Market conditions not met

                                       * Trading session restrictions

                                       * User-defined time filters

                                       * Risk limits reached

Fix:
                                          * Check the Experts and Journal tabs for messages

                                          * Confirm you are within an allowed trading window

                                          * Confirm risk settings are not blocking execution

8. Using too low leverage on broker account
Cause: Account leverage below required range
Fix:
                                             * kazpa software is designed for 1:200–1:500 leverage

                                             * Leverage is set at the account level, not per trade

                                             * If leverage is too low, margin requirements may block trades

⚠️ Lower leverage may prevent proper execution.
________________


9. Using a US-regulated broker
Cause: US brokers typically limit leverage to 1:50
Fix:
                                                * US brokers generally cannot support kazpa’s leverage requirements

                                                * Broker selection is the user’s responsibility

                                                * kazpa does not recommend or manage brokers

10. Software was added before account was fully set up
Cause: Software attached before:
                                                   * Broker account funded

                                                   * Market open

                                                   * Proper symbol available

Fix:
                                                      * Ensure the account is active and tradable

                                                      * Ensure spreads are live

                                                      * Re-attach the software after setup is complete

________________


11. Software removed and re-added without resetting inputs
Cause: Old or incompatible settings loaded
Fix:
                                                         * Remove the software

                                                         * Re-attach it

                                                         * Confirm correct input settings

                                                         * Click OK to re-initialize

________________


12. Software stopped trading after changes were made
Cause: Changes made while AutoTrading was ON
Fix:
                                                            * Turn AutoTrading OFF

                                                            * Make changes (inputs, symbol, timeframe)

                                                            * Turn AutoTrading ON again

This forces a clean restart of execution logic.

13. Trading during major news or low-liquidity periods
Cause: User forgot to disable AutoTrading
Fix:
                                                               * AutoTrading should be turned OFF during:

                                                                  * Major news events

                                                                  * Holidays

                                                                  * Low-liquidity sessions

                                                                     * This is normal risk control behavior

14. VPS connection dropped or MT5 closed
Cause: VPS interruption
Fix:
                                                                        * Reconnect to VPS

                                                                        * Confirm MT5 is open

                                                                        * Confirm AutoTrading is ON

                                                                        * Check charts and software status

________________


15. Expecting trades immediately after attaching software
Cause: Misunderstanding of how execution works
Fix:
                                                                           * kazpa software trades only when conditions are met

                                                                           * No trades ≠ broken software

                                                                           * Patience and discipline are required

________________


16. Software compiled for MT5 but user installed MT4
Cause: Wrong platform
Fix:
                                                                              * kazpa is MT5 only

                                                                              * MT4 is not supported

                                                                              * Install MetaTrader 5 from your broker

________________


17. Multiple softwares attached to the same chart
Cause: Conflicting execution logic
Fix:
                                                                                 * Use one kazpa software per chart

                                                                                 * Do not stack multiple EAs on the same symbol/chart

________________


18. Expecting kazpa to manage trades automatically without oversight
Cause: Incorrect expectations
Fix:
                                                                                    * kazpa provides execution software, not managed accounts

                                                                                    * User remains responsible for:

                                                                                       * Monitoring

                                                                                       * Risk

                                                                                       * When software runs

________________


19. Platform updates reset settings
Cause: MT5 update or broker update
Fix:
                                                                                          * Re-check:

                                                                                             * AutoTrading

                                                                                             * Permissions

                                                                                             * Chart timeframe

                                                                                             * Symbol

                                                                                                * Re-attach software if needed

20. Still not working after all checks
Next steps:
                                                                                                   * Review documentation carefully

                                                                                                   * Check Experts / Journal logs

                                                                                                   * Contact official kazpa support with:

                                                                                                      * MT5 version

                                                                                                      * Broker symbol name

                                                                                                      * Screenshot of chart + Navigator




Sometimes with the vistaX, when you turn on auto trading it will enter a trade right away! You can either close it out or let it run. I recommending closing when back in profit to get out of that. 



Sometimes when you edit the input parameters too, and click ok, itll add another trade, you can close it out and then let the software do its thing.

Final reminder
Most issues are setup-related, not software failures.
Follow steps carefully, do not rush, and treat kazpa as a professional trading tool.
