SECTION 2 — VistaX + VistaONE: Software Overview
This section explains exactly what each software is, how it operates, how they differ, and which type of trader benefits most from each system.
________________


Overview of the kazpa Software Suite
kazpa currently includes two proprietary automated trading softwares:
Software
	Primary Chart
	Pair Behavior
	Style
	VistaX
	XAUUSD (Gold), M5
	Single-pair
	Fast, aggressive, high volatility
	VistaONE
	EURUSD, M15
	Multi-pair execution depending on setfile
	Controlled, diversified, structured
	These are not bots — they are intelligent trading softwares designed to operate autonomously under defined logic, rules, and dynamic market conditions.
Both softwares can produce strong results, but they are built for different risk appetites, different market profiles, and different personalities.
Understanding that difference = long-term success.

VistaONE — Multipair Engine (Runs on EURUSD Chart)
VistaONE anchors on the EURUSD M15 chart, but it is not limited to EURUSD trading.
The currency pairs traded are controlled by the setfile selected: Setfile Example Behavior
Setfile
	Risk Profile
	Pair Behavior
	Conservative
	Lowest volatility exposure
	Trades selected low/medium-volatility FX pairs
	Moderate
	Balanced volatility + opportunity
	Trades additional pairs for more trade flow
	Aggressive
	Higher exposure + faster growth potential
	Expands into higher-momentum pairs
	Meaning:
You run it on EURUSD M15, but the software can execute on multiple FX pairs in the background based on the configuration profile you choose. This makes VistaONE a diversified engine, not a single-pair setup. No gold, no indices, just FX pairs — optimized, steady, controlled flow.

VistaONE Personality
* Most stable software in the kazpa suite

* More consistent day-to-day behavior

* Lower average drawdown compared to gold-based systems

* Designed for structured, methodical account growth

* Ideal for traders who want less psychological pressure

________________


VistaX — Gold Momentum Engine (Single-Pair)
VistaX is built exclusively for XAUUSD (Gold) and runs on the M5 timeframe.
Gold is violent. Gold is explosive. Gold trends until it doesn’t — then it snaps.
VistaX is engineered to operate inside that chaos.
Personality Traits
   * Higher momentum potential

   * Faster equity swings

   * Drawdowns can be deeper

   * Best when managed with proper margin

VistaX is for people who can handle heat, expect volatility, and want velocity.
Not for risk-sensitive traders — VistaONE is better for that profile.
