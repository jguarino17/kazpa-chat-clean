Section 1: Our Mission
Headline:
 Trading Software That Levels the Playing Field
Copy:
 kazpa was founded in 2022 by a group of traders, investors, coders, and algorithmic strategists with a shared mission:
To give everyday people access to institutional-grade tools—and change how they build wealth.
We believe financial freedom should be possible for anyone willing to learn and take control of their capital. That’s why we build software that’s structured, powerful, and built to help you trade smarter—not harder.

Section 2: From the Founder
Headline:
 A Personal Mission to Build Real Freedom
Copy:
 Hi, I’m Joseph Guarino, founder of kazpa.io.
I started kazpa because I wanted real freedom. Not just more income, but passive income—the kind that works while you live. I was working full-time, juggling life like everyone else, wondering how people actually built wealth without grinding themselves into the ground.
I didn’t want to rely on a 9–5 forever. I didn’t want to work two jobs just to put food on the table. I wanted to make money the way hedge funds do—on autopilot.
That’s when I found algorithmic trading.
And everything changed.
I became obsessed with building software that could actually trade for me. I didn’t want fluff. I wanted structure. I wanted something real. Something that could help someone pay rent, fill their gas tank, or completely change their life if they were ready to use it.
And so I built kazpa—not just for myself, but for everyone out there who’s tired of the same cycle and ready for something better.
This software can make you rich.
It can help you stay stable.
Or it can lose money—if you treat it like a game.
That’s the truth. This isn’t a get-rich-quick scheme. It’s a professional-grade system built for people who are serious. If you take the time to learn it and use it wisely, it has the power to flip your financial reality.
And now, we’re giving everyone access.
Because change is coming. The way we invest is evolving—and kazpa is leading the shift.
I built this company to do good in the world. To help real people get ahead. Even if all it does is pay your electric bill or cover next month’s groceries—it matters.
And if you want to go further?
We're here for that too.
— Joseph Guarino
Founder, kazpa.io
