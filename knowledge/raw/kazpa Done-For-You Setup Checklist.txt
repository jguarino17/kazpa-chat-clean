STEP 2 — Review Documentation (Required)
After logging into the Member Dashboard:

You will initially see limited access. This is expected.
Before moving forward, you must:
* Go through the kazpa Documentation
* Learn how to:
   * Open a broker account
   * Set up a trading account correctly
   * Prepare for VPS installation
⚠️ You cannot submit the License Activation Form yet — the next steps must be completed first.

STEP 3 — Create a Broker Account & Trading Account
You must now create a broker account, then open a trading account once verified.
Your trading account must meet these requirements:
* Leverage: 1:500
* Account Type: Pro or RAW
* Platform: MT5 compatible
Save all login details — you will need them later.
________________


STEP 4 — Purchase a VPS (Virtual Private Server)
Once your broker account is active, purchase a VPS.
You may use:
* ForexVPS
* or any reputable VPS provider
After purchasing:
* Download Microsoft Remote Desktop
   * Desktop / Laptop
   * Mobile device (recommended)
Keep your VPS credentials handy.

STEP 5 — Create & Verify a Coinbase Account (Funding)

Why this is required:
* Faster funding
* Instant withdrawals
* No banking delays
What to expect:
* Identity verification required
* Deposit your funds
* New users may experience a 5–7 day clearing period
⚠️ Funding must be completed before setup can begin.

STEP 6 — Submit the License Activation Form (Final Step)
Once all previous steps are completed, return to the Member Dashboard and submit the License Activation Form.
