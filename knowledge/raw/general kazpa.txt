SECTION 1 — Welcome to kazpa
Welcome
Welcome to kazpa.
You now have access to the VistaSUITE, a professional-grade algorithmic trading software suite designed to help traders execute structured strategies with discipline and consistency.
Before using any algorithm live, it is critical that you understand:
   * What kazpa does

   * What kazpa does not do

   * How responsibility is shared (and where it is not)

This course exists to make sure you deploy the VistaSUITE correctly, safely, and intentionally.

What kazpa Is — and Is Not
kazpa IS:
      * A provider of algorithmic trading software

      * A framework for rule-based execution

      * A system that requires user oversight and risk management

kazpa IS NOT:
         * A managed trading service

         * A financial advisor

         * A guarantee of profits

         * A replacement for risk management

At no point does kazpa:
            * Access your funds

            * Place trades without your platform running

            * Control your broker account

You remain in full control at all times.

Your Role as a kazpa User
Using algorithmic software does not remove responsibility — it increases it.
Your responsibilities include:
               * Choosing appropriate account size

               * Selecting proper risk settings

               * Monitoring margin level

               * Knowing when not to trade

               * Turning the software off when conditions are unfavorable

The VistaSUITE is a tool — not a promise.

How to Use This Course
This course is structured to be completed in order.
You should:
                  1. Read each section carefully

                  2. Watch the corresponding videos

                  3. Complete all quizzes before moving forward

                  4. Avoid skipping setup steps

Rushing setup is the #1 cause of poor outcomes.

SECTION 2 — Algorithmic Trading Fundamentals
Introduction to the VistaSUITE
The VistaSUITE is kazpa’s algorithmic trading software package.
It includes:
                     * VistaONE – a multi-pair algorithm designed for structured market behavior

                     * VistaX – a volatility-based algorithm designed specifically for XAUUSD (Gold)

Each algorithm serves a different purpose and must be treated accordingly.
Using the wrong algorithm in the wrong environment increases risk.

VistaONE Overview
VistaONE is designed to:
                        * Trade across multiple currency pairs

                        * Operate within structured market conditions

                        * Emphasize controlled exposure over aggressive growth

VistaONE works best when:
                           * Markets are orderly

                           * Volatility is moderate

                           * Risk settings are conservative

VistaONE is not designed for:
                              * High-impact news trading

                              * Aggressive lot scaling

                              * Emotional interference

________________


VistaX Overview
VistaX is designed specifically for:
                                 * XAUUSD (Gold - M5)

                                 * Volatility-based price behavior

                                 * Short-term execution windows

VistaX requires:
                                    * Strict risk controls

                                    * Attention to margin level

                                    * Awareness of trading sessions

VistaX carries higher risk than VistaONE when misused.

The Trading Platform (MetaTrader 5)
kazpa software operates inside MetaTrader 5 (MT5).
MT5 is the environment where:
                                       * Charts are loaded

                                       * Algorithms are attached

                                       * Orders are executed

                                       * Risk metrics are monitored

Key areas you must understand:
                                          * Market Watch

                                          * Charts

                                          * Terminal (Trade, Exposure, History)

                                          * AutoTrading button

If you do not understand what a button does — do not click it.

Balance vs Equity (Critical Concept)
Balance
                                             * Your account after trades are closed

Equity
                                                * Your balance plus or minus open trades

Equity is what matters for risk control.
Algorithms respond to equity, not emotion.

Margin, Margin Used & Margin Level %
Margin Used
                                                   * Capital currently tied up in open trades

Free Margin
                                                      * Capital still available to trade

Margin Level %
                                                         * One of the most important numbers you must monitor

If Margin Level drops too low:
                                                            * Brokers may close trades automatically

                                                            * Losses can accelerate rapidly

Low margin is not a strategy.
________________


Why Margin Level Matters More Than Profit
Many traders focus on profit and ignore margin.
This is backwards.
You can:
                                                               * Be profitable and still blow an account

                                                               * Lose control even while “up”

Healthy margin levels allow algorithms to function as designed.

Lot Size Fundamentals
Lot size determines exposure, not intelligence.
Common mistakes:
                                                                  * Increasing lot size too early

                                                                  * Scaling based on emotion

                                                                  * Matching lot size to account balance without understanding margin impact

Bigger accounts do not mean:
                                                                     * Bigger trades

                                                                     * Faster results

                                                                     * Less risk

Lot size must match:
                                                                        * Account size

                                                                        * Algorithm type

                                                                        * Market conditions

AutoTrading: What It Really Does
The AutoTrading button allows algorithms to:
                                                                           * Open new trades

                                                                           * Manage existing positions

Turning AutoTrading OFF:
                                                                              * Prevents new trades

                                                                              * Does not delete software

                                                                              * Does not close existing positions automatically

You should turn AutoTrading OFF when:
                                                                                 * Major news events occur

                                                                                 * Market behavior changes unexpectedly

                                                                                 * Risk limits are reached

                                                                                 * You are unsure what is happening

When Not Trading Is the Correct Decision
Professional trading includes:
                                                                                    * Pausing execution

                                                                                    * Preserving capital

                                                                                    * Waiting for clarity

There is no penalty for not trading.
There is a penalty for ignoring risk.

                                                                                       * Know the difference between VistaONE and VistaX

                                                                                       * Understand margin, equity, and exposure

                                                                                       * Respect the importance of risk controls

SECTION 3 — Onboarding & VPS Setup
Introduction
Before any algorithm is installed or activated, your trading environment must be set up correctly.
Most problems users experience with algorithmic trading do not come from the software itself — they come from:
                                                                                          * Poor infrastructure

                                                                                          * Rushed onboarding

                                                                                          * Incomplete setup

                                                                                          * Misunderstanding third-party tools

This section walks you through the non-negotiable foundations required to run the VistaSUITE properly.
________________


Why Infrastructure Matters in Algorithmic Trading
Algorithmic trading software requires:
                                                                                             * Consistent uptime

                                                                                             * Stable internet connectivity

                                                                                             * Low latency

                                                                                             * A controlled environment

Running algorithms on an unreliable computer or unstable connection introduces unnecessary risk.
That is why kazpa requires the use of a Virtual Private Server (VPS).

What Is a VPS?
A Virtual Private Server (VPS) is a remote computer that:
                                                                                                * Runs 24 hours a day

                                                                                                * Is hosted in a professional data center

                                                                                                * Stays online even when your personal device is off

Your VPS becomes the “home” of:
                                                                                                   * MetaTrader 5

                                                                                                   * VistaONE

                                                                                                   * VistaX

                                                                                                   * Your live or demo trading environment

Think of it as a dedicated trading machine.

Why a VPS Is Required for VistaSUITE
Running VistaSUITE on a VPS ensures:
                                                                                                      * No missed trades due to internet drops

                                                                                                      * No interruptions from sleep mode or shutdowns

                                                                                                      * Consistent execution during trading sessions

                                                                                                      * Reduced latency between broker and platform

Without a VPS:
                                                                                                         * Algorithms may stop unexpectedly

                                                                                                         * Trades may fail to open or close

                                                                                                         * Risk controls may not trigger correctly

These risks are avoidable.

VPS Responsibilities (Important)
A VPS does not:
                                                                                                            * Trade for you

                                                                                                            * Manage risk automatically

                                                                                                               * Logging in periodically

                                                                                                               * Monitoring performance

                                                                                                               * Ensuring MetaTrader remains open

                                                                                                               * Turning AutoTrading on or off when needed

The VPS is infrastructure — not intelligence.

Logging Into Your VPS
Access to your VPS is done using Microsoft Remote Desktop.
You will receive:
                                                                                                                  * An IP address

                                                                                                                  * A password

Steps to log in:
                                                                                                                     1. Open Microsoft Remote Desktop

                                                                                                                     2. Enter the VPS IP address

                                                                                                                     3. Enter your login credentials

                                                                                                                     4. Connect

Once connected, you will see a Windows desktop, just like a normal computer.

Inside Your VPS Environment
Your VPS should be used only for trading-related activities.
Recommended use:
                                                                                                                        * MetaTrader 5

                                                                                                                        * Broker platform tools

                                                                                                                        * Myfxbook (optional tracking)

Avoid:
                                                                                                                           * Web browsing

                                                                                                                           * Downloads unrelated to trading

                                                                                                                           * Streaming or heavy background apps

The goal is stability, not convenience.

Always start with a demo account.

Demo vs Live Accounts
Demo Accounts
                                                                                                                                    * Simulated funds

                                                                                                                                    * Real market prices

                                                                                                                                    * No financial risk

Demo accounts are used to:
                                                                                                                                       * Test installation

                                                                                                                                       * Confirm settings

                                                                                                                                       * Observe behavior

                                                                                                                                       * Learn risk mechanics

Live Accounts
                                                                                                                                          * Real capital

                                                                                                                                          * Real risk

                                                                                                                                          * Emotional impact

You should never move to live trading until:
                                                                                                                                             * You fully understand the software

                                                                                                                                             * You are comfortable with drawdown behavior

                                                                                                                                             * You have verified risk controls work as expected

Funding Your Broker Account (Live Trading)
When you choose to fund a live account:
                                                                                                                                                * Start with capital you can afford to lose

                                                                                                                                                * Do not “max out” your intended allocation

                                                                                                                                                * Expect variability and drawdowns

Algorithmic trading is not linear.
Scaling should happen over time, not immediately.

Licensing the VistaSUITE
Licensing is the final step before live deployment.
You should request licensing only when:
                                                                                                                                                   * VPS is fully set up

                                                                                                                                                   * Broker account is created

                                                                                                                                                   * MetaTrader 5 is installed

                                                                                                                                                   * You understand the fundamentals

Each license:
                                                                                                                                                      * Is environment-specific

                                                                                                                                                      * Is tied to your setup

                                                                                                                                                      * Cannot be rushed or reused improperly

Licensing too early causes delays and confusion.

Common Onboarding Mistakes to Avoid
                                                                                                                                                         * Skipping demo testing

                                                                                                                                                         * Installing software before understanding risk

                                                                                                                                                         * Running algorithms on personal laptops

                                                                                                                                                         * Increasing lot size prematurely

                                                                                                                                                         * Ignoring margin level

                                                                                                                                                         * Treating the VPS as “set and forget”
