Risk Warning
Before deciding to participate on the Platform, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level or experience, and risk appetite. Do not invest money you cannot afford to lose.
You acknowledge and understand that all investments involve risk, that losses may exceed the principal invested, and that the performance of a security, industry, sector, market, or product does not guarantee future results or returns. You are solely responsible for all investment decisions associated with your account. 
There are risks associated with utilizing an Internet-based trading system including, but not limited to, the failure of hardware, software, and Internet connection. We are not responsible for communication failures or delays when trading via the Internet. 
Required Disclaimer - Trading foreign exchange (“forex”) on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest in forex you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with forex trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.
The purchase, sale or advice regarding forex can only be performed by persons registered with (unless exempt from registration) (i) the CFTC (futures commission merchants, introducing brokers, commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, retail foreign exchange dealers, and licensed associated persons of such entities), and/or (ii) the SEC (broker-dealers and/or investment advisers and their licensed associated persons), and (iii) a state regulator (each, an “Intermediary”). Neither we, nor our affiliates or associated persons involved in the production and maintenance of our products and services or this website, is an Intermediary. All purchasers of products and services referenced on this website are encouraged to consult with an investment professional regarding any trading strategy or a particular trade. We make no representation that you will or are likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those discussed on this website. The past performance of any trading system or methodology is not necessarily indicative of future results
We emphasize that no information set forth on this website is an invitation to trade any specific investments. Trading requires risking money in pursuit of future gain. That is your decision. Do not risk any money you cannot afford to lose. This website does not take into account your own individual financial and personal circumstances. It is intended for educational purposes only and NOT as individual investment advice. Do not act on this information without advice from your investment professional, who you should expect to determine what is suitable for your particular needs and circumstances. Failure to seek detailed professional, personally-tailored advice prior to making any investment could result in actions contrary to your best interests and loss of capital.
*CFTC RULE 4.41(b)(1)/NFA RULE 2-29 - SIMULATED OR HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE CERTAIN INHERENT LIMITATIONS. UNLIKE THE RESULTS SHOWN IN AN ACTUAL PERFORMANCE RECORD, THESE RESULTS DO NOT REPRESENT ACTUAL TRADING. ALSO, BECAUSE THESE TRADES HAVE NOT ACTUALLY BEEN EXECUTED, THESE RESULTS MAY HAVE UNDER-OR-OVER COMPENSATED FOR THE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF CERTAIN MARKET FACTORS, SUCH AS LACK OF LIQUIDITY. SIMULATED OR HYPOTHETICAL TRADING PROGRAMS IN GENERAL ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE DESIGNED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFIT OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE BEING SHOWN.
NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY PERSON WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM.
IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS.

Governing Law
All matters relating to the Platform and these Terms of Use, and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Florida without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Florida or any other jurisdiction).


Arbitration
Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of, or related to, these Terms of Use or the Platform shall be instituted exclusively in final and binding arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association applying Florida law, and not as a class, collective, coordinated, mass, and/or representative action. Arbitration will preclude you from bringing any class, collective, coordinated, consolidated, mass and/or representative action against us, and also preclude you from participating or recovering relief in any current or future class, collective, coordinated, consolidated, mass, and/or representative action brought against us by someone else. Thus, the parties agree that the arbitrator shall not conduct any form of class, collective, coordinated, consolidated, mass, and/or representative arbitration, nor join, coordinate, or consolidate claims of multiple individuals against us in a single proceeding. For the avoidance of doubt, this agreement precludes from bringing or participating in any kind of class, collective, coordinated, consolidated, mass and/or representative or other kind of group, multi-plaintiff or joint action against us, other than participating in a classwide, collective, coordinated, consolidated, mass and/or representative settlement of claims.

This arbitration provision survives after your relationship with us ends. If you do not wish to be bound by this arbitration provision you must immediately cease using the Platform and you must provide notice by contacting us at the contact information provided below. 


Limitation on Time to File Claims
ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE PLATFORM MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.


Waiver and Severability
No waiver by the Company of any term or condition set out in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the Company to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect. 


Force Majeure
The Company shall be released from any liability for the complete or partial nonfulfilment or improper fulfillment of obligations provided by these Terms of Use if it has occurred as a result of force majeure circumstances, which are understood as any external circumstances that arose through no fault of the Company, which were not of its will, or contrary to its will and which could not be foreseen or avoided, including natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, destruction due to lightning, etc.), public life circumstances (military actions, public disturbances, epidemics, pandemics, strikes, etc.) that prevent or make it impossible for the Company to fulfill its obligations hereunder. The Company shall notify you by reasonable means to notify you about the existence of force majeure circumstances and their impact on the fulfillment of obligations under the Terms of Use. Force majeure shall not be the reason for your unilateral termination of these Terms of Use. The Company’s fulfillment of the Terms of Use shall be temporarily suspended during the period of force majeure circumstances and restored after their end.
