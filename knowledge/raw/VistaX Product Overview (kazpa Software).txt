Section 2: Core Concept
Title:
 Your Strategy. Our Execution Engine.
Description:
 VistaX is an active, high-performance trading algorithm built for short windows of opportunity. It doesn’t run all day—and it’s not meant to. You decide when to turn it on. It does the rest.
Perfect for sessions like London Open, VistaX enters with size, closes fast, and respects risk. This is not a bot you sleep on—it’s a tool you use to develop your edge and compound results quickly.
Three feature blurbs (use icons):
* ⚡ Scalp Mode Enabled
 Designed for short, controlled bursts during high-volume windows.

* 🔍 Session-Based Precision
 Best used 1–2 hours per day with sniper entry logic.

* 💥 Built to Flip Accounts
 Higher risk, higher reward—if you know how to use it right.

Section 5: Why It Works
Title:
 Speed + Logic + Control = Power
Description:
 VistaX uses a structured, progressive logic system that enters trades with size, closes with intent, and follows your session rules. It can be turned on and off like a machine—but its results are anything but mechanical.
Core logic:
         * ✅ Trade entry at fixed pip intervals or time-based filters

         * ✅ Progressive lot size increase using multiplier logic

         * ✅ Auto-close based on net profit target or smart exit

         * ✅ Equity protection to prevent runaway losses

         * ✅ Optional filters for EMA, candle patterns, AOI proximity

Section 6: How It Works
Title:
 A Strategic Tool. Not a Toy.
Steps (numbered):
            1. Load VistaX on an M5 XAUUSD chart

            2. Define your session time window (e.g., 4AM–6AM EST)

            3. Configure your risk profile, multiplier, and lot strategy

            4. Activate AutoTrading when you're ready

            5. Turn it off after session is complete—or let it finish cleanly

Use it 1–2 hours per day. Monitor trades. Learn the behavior.
VistaX rewards those who trade it like a professional tool.
