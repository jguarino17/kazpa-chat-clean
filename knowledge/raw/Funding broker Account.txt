Welcome to our step-by-step guide on getting your trading account started with your broker. Today, we'll sign into your account, create an MT5 trading account, and fund it. Let's dive in.


Signing In:
First, navigate to your broker's homepage and click on the 'Client Portal' or 'Sign In' button. Use your registration email and password to log in. You might be asked for a two-factor authentication code for extra security.


Exploring the Client Portal:
Once inside the client portal, you have access to various options like depositing or withdrawing funds and creating trading accounts. Let's set up your first live trading account.


Creating a Trading Account:
To create a live trading account, look for the 'Apply for an Account' button. Select 'MT4' as the platform type, choose your preferred currency, and select 'Pro' for account type to save on trading fees. For leverage, we recommend anything from 1:200 to 1:500 for algorithmic trading. Agree to the terms and confirm.


Receiving Account Details:
Shortly, you'll receive an email with your trading account details, including a username and password. Keep these safe as we'll need them to connect to the MT4 terminal.


Funding Your Account
Now, let's fund your account. Back in the client portal, click on 'Deposit.' You'll see options for funding, including instant crypto deposits or traditional bank wires. Choose your preferred method and follow the prompts to complete your deposit.


Crypto Deposit
For crypto, select your trading account, enter the deposit amount, choose your cryptocurrency, and confirm. You'll be provided with a QR code and wallet address for the transfer.


Bank Wire Deposit
For bank wires, select your account and confirm. Choose your currency and enter the amount. You'll then select between BIC/SWIFT for international transfers or ABA for domestic. Follow the provided banking details to initiate the wire from your bank, and don't forget to double-check the information for accuracy.


Final Steps
Once your deposit is made, you'll receive a confirmation. Simply email your broker's support team with the transaction details to confirm your deposit was sent.
