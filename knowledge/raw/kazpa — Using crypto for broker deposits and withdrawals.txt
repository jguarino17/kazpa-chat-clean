Why many users choose crypto for funding broker accounts
Many kazpa users prefer crypto deposits and withdrawals because they are:
* Faster — often minutes instead of days

* Available 24/7 — weekends and holidays included

* Lower friction — fewer intermediary banks

* More predictable — no banking cutoff times

By contrast, traditional bank wires or ACH transfers:
   * can take 2–3 business days or longer,

   * do not process on weekends or holidays,

   * may be delayed or rejected by intermediary banks.

Crypto does not rely on banking hours, which makes it a practical option for users who want quicker access to funds.

Common crypto used: USDT (ERC-20)
One of the most commonly used assets for broker funding is USDT (Tether) on the ERC-20 (Ethereum) network.
Why ERC-20 USDT is commonly used:
      * Widely supported by brokers

      * Stable value (pegged to USD)

      * Clear transaction tracking

      * Compatible with major exchanges

⚠️ Always confirm network type (ERC-20 vs TRC-20 vs others) before sending. Sending to the wrong network can result in permanent loss.

Example flow: Coinbase → Broker (USDT ERC-20)
Step 1: Buy or hold USDT on Coinbase
         * Log into your Coinbase account

         * Purchase USDT or convert from another asset

         * Ensure you are holding USDT on Ethereum (ERC-20)

Note: Coinbase may place a temporary hold on newly purchased crypto (commonly 24–72 hours) before it can be withdrawn. This is an exchange policy, not a kazpa or broker rule.

Step 2: Get the broker’s deposit address
            * Log into your broker account

            * Navigate to Deposit / Funding

            * Select Crypto → USDT → ERC-20

            * Copy the wallet address exactly

Double-check:
               * Asset: USDT

               * Network: ERC-20

               * Address: correct and complete

________________


Step 3: Send USDT from Coinbase
                  * In Coinbase, choose Send

                  * Paste the broker’s ERC-20 USDT address

                  * Enter the amount

                  * Review network fees (Ethereum gas)

                  * Confirm the transaction

Once sent:
                     * The transaction will appear on the blockchain within minutes

                     * Network confirmation time varies but is typically fast

________________


Step 4: Broker processing time
After blockchain confirmation:
                        * Some brokers credit accounts almost instantly

                        * Others may require manual confirmation (minutes to a few hours)

This delay depends on the broker’s internal processing, not the blockchain itself.

Withdrawing funds via crypto
The withdrawal process is similar in reverse:
                           1. Request a crypto withdrawal from your broker

                           2. Provide your USDT ERC-20 wallet address (for example, Coinbase)

                           3. Broker processes the request

                           4. Funds arrive in your exchange wallet once confirmed

Crypto withdrawals often settle faster than bank withdrawals, especially outside business hours.

Fees and costs
                                 * Crypto transfers include network fees (Ethereum gas for ERC-20)

                                 * Fees vary based on network congestion

                                 * Even with fees, crypto is often competitive compared to international wires

Always review fees before sending.

Taxes and reporting (important)
                                    * The exchange you use (such as Coinbase) typically provides transaction history and tax documents

                                    * These reports can be shared with your tax strategist or accountant

                                    * Tax treatment varies by country and individual situation

kazpa does not provide tax guidance. Always consult a qualified professional.

Key reminders
                                       * Always confirm asset + network before sending

                                       * Never rush a transfer — double-check addresses

                                       * Expect possible exchange withdrawal holds

                                       * Keep records of all transactions

                                       * Use only wallets and exchanges you control
