# VPS Overview — What It Is, Why It’s Used, and When You Need One

This page explains what a VPS is, why it’s commonly used with kazpa software, and when it is recommended.

A VPS is not mandatory, but it is strongly recommended for most users.

## What a VPS Is

A VPS (Virtual Private Server) is a remote computer that:
- Runs continuously
- Stays online 24/7
- Can be accessed from anywhere
- Is independent of your personal device

Think of a VPS as a dedicated Windows machine that lives online instead of on your desk.

---

## Why a VPS Is Recommended for kazpa

kazpa software runs inside **MetaTrader 5 (MT5)**.

Using a VPS helps ensure:
- MT5 stays open continuously
- Software can run without interruption
- Execution is not affected by:
  - your computer shutting down
  - internet outages
  - sleep mode
  - local system updates

A VPS improves **consistency**, not performance guarantees.

---

## What a VPS Does NOT Do

A VPS does not:
- Remove trading risk
- Improve strategy logic
- Guarantee better results
- Eliminate drawdown
- Replace monitoring

A VPS is an infrastructure tool, not a trading advantage.

---

## When a VPS Is Strongly Recommended

A VPS is strongly recommended if:
- You plan to run software continuously (e.g., VistaONE)
- You do not want MT5 tied to your personal computer
- You want execution to continue when your device is offline
- You want stable uptime

Most users running kazpa long-term use a VPS.

---

## When a VPS Is Optional

A VPS may be optional if:
- You are testing on demo
- You only run software during short sessions
- You are able to keep MT5 open and monitored locally
- You understand the risks of interruptions

Even in these cases, many users still prefer a VPS for reliability.

---

## VPS Responsibilities (User-Controlled)

If you use a VPS, you are responsible for:
- Choosing a VPS provider
- Managing login credentials
- Keeping the VPS secure
- Installing MT5 correctly
- Monitoring execution regularly

kazpa does not manage VPS servers and is not affiliated with VPS providers.

---

## Common VPS Mistakes

Users often run into problems when they:
- Close the VPS window instead of disconnecting
- Log out of Windows instead of disconnecting the session
- Allow the VPS to auto-restart during trading
- Forget to monitor MT5 after setup
- Assume the VPS “handles everything”

A VPS still requires oversight.

---

## Monitoring Expectations

Even with a VPS:
- You should check MT5 regularly
- You should confirm AutoTrading status
- You should pause execution during major events
- You should stop execution if behavior looks abnormal

A VPS allows continuous operation, not unattended operation.

---

## Final Perspective

A VPS is a **reliability tool**.

It helps keep MT5 running consistently, but it does not:
- Remove risk
- Replace discipline
- Make trading passive

For most kazpa users, a VPS provides peace of mind and stability when used responsibly.
