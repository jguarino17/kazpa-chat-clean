# Getting Started with kazpa

This page explains what kazpa is, what it is not, and how to think about using it responsibly.

If anything here feels unclear or misaligned with your expectations, pause before proceeding.

kazpa is built for disciplined users who understand that **structure does not remove risk**.

## What kazpa Is

kazpa provides **licensed trading software** designed to run inside **MetaTrader 5 (MT5)**.

kazpa software:
- Executes trades based on predefined logic
- Helps reduce emotional decision-making
- Enforces structure and consistency
- Requires user oversight and responsibility

kazpa does not trade on your behalf.
kazpa does not touch your funds.
kazpa does not make decisions for you.

You install and run the software on **your own MT5 account**, typically on a VPS.

---

## What kazpa Is NOT

kazpa is not:
- A managed account
- A signal service
- A financial advisor
- A profit guarantee
- A passive income system
- A “set and forget forever” solution

Automation does not remove responsibility.
It changes *how* decisions are executed, not *who* owns them.

---

## User Responsibility (Critical)

When using kazpa, **you** control:
- The broker you use
- Whether the account is demo or live
- Account size and capital exposure
- Risk configuration
- When AutoTrading is enabled or disabled
- When the software runs or is paused

You are responsible for gains **and** losses.

kazpa provides tools.
Users provide decisions.

---

## Risk Awareness

Trading involves risk.
Losses and drawdown are possible.

Different configurations, markets, and conditions will produce different outcomes.
Past performance does not guarantee future results.

kazpa software should always be:
- Tested on demo first
- Monitored during live execution
- Paused during major news, low-liquidity periods, or uncertainty

If you are uncomfortable with drawdown, kazpa may not be a good fit.

---

## Who kazpa Is For

kazpa is designed for users who:
- Want structure instead of emotional trading
- Are willing to monitor execution
- Understand that automation is not passive
- Accept that risk cannot be eliminated
- Prefer rules and discipline over impulse

Experience helps, but mindset matters more.

---

## Who kazpa Is NOT For

kazpa may not be appropriate if you:
- Want guaranteed results
- Expect zero drawdown
- Are looking for fast or easy money
- Do not want to monitor trades
- Want someone else to manage risk for you

Discipline and responsibility are required.

---

## The Vista Suite (High-Level)

kazpa licenses two distinct trading softwares as part of the **Vista Suite**:

- **VistaONE**  
  Designed for longer-term, structured automation with a lower-stress profile.

- **VistaX**  
  Designed for session-based execution with higher risk and higher responsibility.

Each software serves a different type of user and objective.
They are not interchangeable.

Detailed explanations are provided in their respective sections.

---

## Before You Proceed

Before applying or setting anything up, you should be comfortable with the following:

- You control risk
- Losses are possible
- Monitoring is required
- Automation does not mean passive income
- Fit matters more than speed

If this aligns with how you think about trading and risk, you can continue learning about the Vista Suite and setup process.

If not, it’s better to stop here.

## Next Step

If this framework aligns with your expectations, the next step is to learn how each software works and determine which is appropriate for your experience level.
