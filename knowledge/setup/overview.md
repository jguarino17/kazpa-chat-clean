# kazpa Setup — High-Level Flow & Order of Operations

This page explains the **correct setup sequence** for running kazpa software.

Follow the order exactly.
Skipping steps or rushing setup is the most common cause of errors, losses, and confusion.

If something here feels unclear, stop and get clarity before proceeding.

---

## The Correct Setup Order (Overview)

kazpa setup follows this order:

1. Understand responsibility and risk
2. Choose demo vs live
3. Create and verify a broker account
4. Set up a VPS (recommended)
5. Install MetaTrader 5 (MT5)
6. Activate your kazpa license
7. Install the trading software
8. Configure risk and settings
9. Run on demo
10. Move to live only when ready

Each step builds on the previous one.
Do not jump ahead.

---

## Step 1 — Responsibility First (Non-Negotiable)

Before any technical setup:
- Understand that kazpa does not manage funds
- Accept that losses and drawdown are possible
- Know that you control risk and execution
- Be willing to monitor automation

If this mindset is not clear, do not proceed.

---

## Step 2 — Demo vs Live Decision

Users must decide:
- Demo account (recommended first)
- Live account (only after demo understanding)

Demo use allows:
- Learning behavior
- Understanding drawdown
- Testing monitoring routines
- Reducing costly mistakes

kazpa strongly encourages demo testing before live use.

---

## Step 3 — Broker Account Creation

Users must:
- Choose their own broker
- Ensure the broker supports MT5
- Verify account credentials
- Understand leverage and margin

kazpa is not affiliated with brokers and does not make broker recommendations.
Due diligence is the user’s responsibility.

---

## Step 4 — VPS Setup (Recommended)

A VPS is strongly recommended to:
- Keep MT5 running consistently
- Avoid local computer interruptions
- Reduce connectivity issues

Users are responsible for:
- VPS selection
- VPS security
- VPS access credentials

kazpa does not control VPS providers.

---

## Step 5 — MetaTrader 5 Installation

MT5 must be:
- Installed on the VPS (or local machine if not using VPS)
- Logged into the correct trading account
- Fully functional before software installation

Only **MetaTrader 5** is supported.
MT4 is not supported.

---

## Step 6 — License Activation

Before running kazpa software:
- License must be activated
- Account details must be correct
- Platform must be properly connected

License activation confirms authorized use.
Running without activation will not work.

---

## Step 7 — Software Installation

After license activation:
- Install the kazpa trading software into MT5
- Confirm it loads correctly
- Verify required permissions
- Confirm AutoTrading behavior

Do not skip verification steps.

---

## Step 8 — Risk Configuration

Users must configure:
- Risk mode
- Lot sizing
- Trade windows (especially for VistaX)
- AutoTrading behavior

Risk configuration should be:
- Conservative at first
- Tested on demo
- Adjusted only with understanding

kazpaGPT may explain concepts but will not give exact settings.

---

## Step 9 — Demo Testing Phase

Before live use:
- Run on demo
- Observe behavior during drawdown
- Practice turning AutoTrading ON/OFF
- Confirm comfort with monitoring

Rushing to live increases risk unnecessarily.

---

## Step 10 — Transition to Live (Optional)

Only consider live execution when:
- Demo behavior is understood
- Risk tolerance is realistic
- Monitoring routine is established
- Drawdown expectations are clear

Live use is optional.
There is no requirement to go live.

---

## Common Setup Mistakes (Avoid These)

- Skipping demo testing
- Running software without monitoring
- Using excessive risk
- Leaving VistaX running outside sessions
- Ignoring drawdown expectations
- Making changes during live execution

Most problems come from rushing.

---

## When to Stop and Ask Questions

Users should pause setup if:
- Something does not behave as expected
- Error messages appear
- Credentials seem incorrect
- Risk feels uncomfortable
- Instructions feel unclear

Asking questions early prevents costly mistakes.

---

## Final Setup Perspective

kazpa setup is not difficult, but it must be done **deliberately**.

Success comes from:
- Following the correct order
- Understanding responsibility
- Testing before risking capital
- Monitoring execution consistently

Structure matters more than speed.
