# Risk Configuration — Principles, Control, and Safe Setup

This page explains how risk configuration works when using kazpa software.

Risk configuration is one of the **most important responsibilities** a user has.
Incorrect risk settings are the leading cause of unacceptable drawdown and losses.

kazpaGPT may explain concepts, but will never provide exact values or financial advice.

## What Risk Configuration Means

Risk configuration defines how much exposure your account takes during execution.

It includes:
- Risk mode selection
- Lot sizing behavior
- Trade frequency limits
- Session boundaries (especially for VistaX)

Risk configuration directly impacts:
- Drawdown size
- Margin usage
- Emotional stress
- Account longevity

Higher risk increases both potential upside **and** downside.

---

## User Responsibility (Non-Negotiable)

Users are fully responsible for:
- Choosing risk levels
- Understanding drawdown tolerance
- Adjusting exposure
- Pausing or stopping execution

kazpa does not set risk for users.
kazpaGPT does not tell users what settings to use.

---

## Conservative First Principle

kazpa strongly encourages:
- Starting with the most conservative configuration
- Testing on demo
- Observing behavior during drawdown
- Increasing exposure only after understanding behavior

Rushing risk increases mistakes.
Discipline reduces them.

---

## Risk vs Account Size Relationship

Risk is **relative**, not absolute.

Important concepts:
- Smaller accounts experience drawdown faster
- Higher leverage amplifies risk
- Lot sizing compounds exposure
- Multiple trades increase margin usage

What feels small on one account may be excessive on another.

---

## VistaONE Risk Considerations

VistaONE is designed for:
- Lower stress
- Longer time horizons
- Continuous execution

Users should:
- Prioritize account longevity
- Accept slower progression
- Avoid aggressive configurations
- Monitor regularly despite continuous operation

VistaONE is not immune to drawdown.

---

## VistaX Risk Considerations

VistaX requires **heightened risk awareness**.

Key differences:
- Faster execution
- Higher volatility (Gold)
- Session-based exposure
- Drawdown can occur quickly

VistaX users must:
- Limit execution to defined sessions
- Turn AutoTrading OFF outside sessions
- Be comfortable managing margin actively
- Accept higher stress and responsibility

VistaX is not appropriate for conservative risk tolerance.

---

## Lot Sizing (Conceptual Only)

Lot size controls trade exposure.

kazpaGPT may explain:
- Larger lots increase drawdown
- Smaller lots reduce stress
- Lot size must align with account size

kazpaGPT will never recommend:
- Specific lot sizes
- Exact ratios
- “Optimal” configurations

Those decisions belong to the user.

---

## When to Adjust Risk (and When Not To)

Risk adjustments may be appropriate:
- After demo testing
- After understanding drawdown behavior
- During calm market conditions
- With full awareness of consequences

Risk should NOT be adjusted:
- During live trades
- During drawdown reactions
- During high volatility
- Based on emotion or frustration

Changing risk mid-execution increases errors.

---

## Common Risk Configuration Mistakes

Avoid these behaviors:
- Starting too aggressive
- Increasing risk to recover losses
- Copying someone else’s settings
- Ignoring margin usage
- Leaving VistaX running unattended
- Confusing automation with safety

Most account damage is self-inflicted through risk misuse.

---

## Demo Testing Requirement

Demo testing allows users to:
- Experience drawdown safely
- Learn system behavior
- Practice monitoring
- Understand emotional response to losses

Demo success does not guarantee live success.
Demo failure is a learning opportunity.

---

## Stop Conditions (Very Important)

Users should stop or pause execution if:
- Drawdown exceeds comfort level
- Margin usage feels unclear
- Execution behavior is not understood
- Emotional stress increases
- Market conditions change unexpectedly

Stopping execution is responsible, not failure.

---

## Final Risk Perspective

Risk configuration defines your experience.

kazpa provides structured execution.
Risk decisions belong to the user.

Users who succeed:
- Start conservative
- Monitor consistently
- Adjust slowly
- Respect drawdown
- Prioritize survival over speed

Structure protects discipline.
Discipline protects capital.
