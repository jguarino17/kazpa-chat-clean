# License Activation — When, How, and Common Issues

This page explains how kazpa license activation works, when it should be done, and the most common mistakes users make.

License activation must be completed **at the correct point** in the setup process.

Activating too early or incorrectly will cause problems.

## What License Activation Is

License activation authorizes your kazpa software to run on a specific MT5 environment.

Activation:
- Confirms licensed access
- Links the software to your setup
- Allows execution once AutoTrading is enabled

Activation does **not**:
- Configure risk
- Guarantee execution
- Verify broker quality
- Confirm profitability

---

## When to Activate (Very Important)

License activation should be done **only after**:

- Your broker account is created and verified
- MT5 is installed and working correctly
- You are logged into the correct MT5 account
- Your VPS (if used) is set up and stable

Do **not** activate:
- Before MT5 is installed
- Before choosing demo vs live
- Before confirming account credentials
- On multiple environments unless instructed

Activating too early is the most common mistake.

## Correct Activation Order

Follow this sequence:

1. Install MT5
2. Log into the correct trading account
3. Confirm MT5 is stable and connected
4. Install kazpa software
5. Activate the license
6. Verify successful activation
7. Configure risk settings
8. Test on demo

Do not change environments mid-activation.

---

## Activation Environment Rules

Licenses are tied to:
- A specific MT5 installation
- A specific environment (local machine or VPS)

If you:
- Change VPS
- Reinstall MT5
- Switch machines

You may need re-activation through official support.

Do not attempt repeated activations without guidance.

---

## How to Confirm Successful Activation

After activation:
- The software should load without license errors
- Status indicators should confirm authorization
- No repeated activation prompts should appear

If execution does not occur:
- Check AutoTrading status
- Confirm correct chart and timeframe
- Confirm risk configuration

Most “not trading” issues are **not** license-related.

---

## Common Activation Mistakes

Avoid the following:
- Activating before MT5 is ready
- Activating on the wrong account
- Activating on demo when you intended live (or vice versa)
- Reinstalling MT5 immediately after activation
- Attempting multiple activations without support

These mistakes cause unnecessary delays.

---

## If Activation Fails

If activation fails or errors appear:

1. Stop and do not retry repeatedly
2. Confirm your setup matches requirements
3. Gather relevant details:
   - MT5 account type (demo or live)
   - Broker name
   - Environment (VPS or local)
4. Contact official kazpa support with details

kazpaGPT will never request license keys directly.

---

## Escalation to Support

License issues must be escalated if:
- Activation errors persist
- You changed environments
- You are unsure where activation occurred
- Software reports authorization issues

Support will guide you safely.

---

## Final Perspective

License activation is a **technical authorization step**, not a setup shortcut.

Done correctly:
- It happens once
- It enables proper execution
- It prevents future issues

Rushing activation creates problems.
Follow the order.
